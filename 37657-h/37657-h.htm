<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p>Some explanation is perhaps due from a writer who adopts
the title of Comic in relation to a subject which is ordinarily
considered to be so essentially grave as that of History.
Though the epithet may be thought by many inappropriate
to the theme, this work has been prompted by a very serious
desire to instruct those who, though willing to acquire information,
seek in doing so as much amusement as possible.</p>

<p>It is true that professedly Comic literature has been the
subject of a familiarity not unmixed with contempt on the part
of a portion of the public, since that class of writing obtained
the popularity which has especially attended it within the last
few years; but as whatever disrepute it has fallen into is
owing entirely to its abuse, there is no reason for abandoning
an attempt to make a right use of it. The title of Comic
has therefore been retained in reference to this work, though
the author has felt that its purport is likely to be misconceived
by many, and among them not a few whose judgment he would
highly esteem, who would turn away from a Comic History
solely on account of its name, and without giving themselves
the trouble to look into it. Those persons are, however,
grievously mistaken who have imagined that in this, and in
similar books from the same pen, the object has been to treat
History as a mere farce, or to laugh at Truth&mdash;the aim of
the writer having invariably been to expose falsehood, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
bring into merited contempt all that has been injudiciously,
ignorantly, or dishonestly held up to general admiration. His
method of telling a story may be objected to; nevertheless, if he
does his utmost to tell it truly, he ought not, perhaps, to be very
severely criticised for adopting the style in which he feels himself
most at home; and if his opinions are found to be, in the
main, such as just and sensible persons can agree with, he only
asks that his views and sentiments may be estimated by what
they contain, and not by any peculiarity in his mode of
expressing them.</p>

<p>The writer of this book is animated by an earnest wish to
aid, as far as he is able, in the project of combining instruction
with amusement; and he trusts he shall not be blamed for
endeavouring to render such ability as he possesses available
for as much as it is worth, in applying it to subjects of useful
information.</p>

<p>Those who are not disposed to approve of his design, will
perhaps give him credit for his motive; and he may with confidence
assert, that, from the care and attention he has bestowed
upon this work, it will be found to form (irrespective of its
claims to amuse) by no means the least compendious and
correct of the histories already in existence of Rome to
the end of the Commonwealth. If he has failed in justifying
the application of the title of Comic to his work, he has reason
to believe it will be found accurate. Though the style professes
to be light, he would submit that truth does not necessarily
make more impression by being conveyed through a heavy
medium; and although facts may be playfully told, it is hoped
that narrative in sport may be found to constitute history in
earnest.</p>

<span class="caption">Æneas and Anchises</span>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">he</span> origin of the Romans has long
been lost in that impenetrable
fog, the mist of ages; which, it
is to be feared, will never clear
off, for it unfortunately seems to
grow thicker the more boldly we
try to grope about in it. In the
midst of these fogs, some energetic
individual will now and then
appear with a pretty powerful link,
but there are not enough of these
links to form a connected chain
of incidents.</p>

<p>One of the oldest and most
popular traditions concerning the
origin of the Romans, is that
founded on the remarkable feat of
filial pick-a-back alleged to have
been performed by Æneas, who
is frequently dragged in head
and shoulders, with his venerable
parent, to lead off the march of
events, and, as it were, open the
ball of history.</p>

<p>It is said that after<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the siege of Troy, Æneas snatched up his Lares
and Penates in one hand, and his father, Anchises, in the other;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
when, flinging the former over the right shoulder, and the latter
over the left, he ran down to the sea-shore, called "A boat a-hoy,"
and escaped from the jaws of destruction into the mouth of the Tiber.
There are many reasons for disbelieving this story, and it is quite
enough to deprive it of weight to consider what must have been the
weight of Anchises himself, and the large bundle of household images
that Æneas is alleged to have been burdened with. Putting probability
in one scale, and an elderly gentleman, with a lot of Lares and a
parcel of Penates in the other, there can be no doubt which will preponderate.
It happens, also, that Troy is usually said to have been
destroyed 430 years before Rome was founded,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> so that it would have
been to this day as unfounded as the tale itself, if the city had had
no other foundation than that which Æneas was supposed to have
given it.</p>

<p>The Latin Bards have adorned this story in their own peculiar way,
by adding that Æneas, on his arrival in the Tiber, resolved to sacrifice
a milk white sow, in gratitude for his safety. The sow, who must have
been an ancestor of the learned pig, got scent of her fate, and running
two or three miles up the country, produced a sad litter of thirty little
ones; when Æneas, fancying he heard a voice telling him to build a
town on the spot, determined, "please the pigs," to found a city there.
The classical story-teller goes on to say, that Latinus, king of the
Latins, happened to be at war with Turnus&mdash;or as we might call him
Turner&mdash;King of the Rutuli, when the Trojans arrived, and the
former, thinking it better worth his while to make friends than foes of
the immigrants, gave them a tract of land, which rendered them extremely
tractable. On the principle that one good turn deserves
another, they turned round upon Turnus, and completely routed the
Rutuli. Latinus, to show his gratitude, gave Lavinia&mdash;not the "lovely
young" one, who Thomson tells us, "once had friends;" but his own
daughter of that name&mdash;in marriage to Æneas, who at the death of his
father-in-law, ruled over the city, and called his colony Lavinium.
Tradition tells us further that Æneas had a son, Ascanius, sometimes
called Parvus Iulus, or little Juli, who subsequently left Lavinium, and
built Alba Longa&mdash;a sort of classical long acre&mdash;in that desirable neighbourhood
known as the Alban Mount, which, from its becoming subsequently
the most fashionable part of the city, may deserve the name of
the Roman Albany.</p>

<p>The descendants of Ascanius are said to have reigned 300 years, and
an attempt has been made to fill up the gap of these three centuries
with a quantity of dry rubbish of the antiquarian kind, which occupies
space, without affording anything like a solid foundation for the structure
to be built upon it. Of such a nature is the catalogue of matters alleged
to have connected Æneas with the actual founders of Rome; but though
names and dates are given, there is little doubt that the value of names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
is not even nominal, and that if we trust the dates, we shall rely on the
falsest data.</p>

<p>The spirit of antiquarianism is as ancient as the subjects on which it
employs its ingenuity, and the Romans began puzzling themselves at
a very early period about their own origin. A long course of fabrication
ended in rearing up a legendary fabric, which was acknowledged by all
the Roman bards; and however much they may have doubted the
truth of the tale, they deserve some credit for the consistency with
which they have adhered to it.</p>

<p>The legend states that one Procas, belonging to the family of the
Silvii, or Silvers, had two sons,&mdash;the elder, to whom the kingdom was
left, being called Numitor, and the younger going by the name of
Amulius. Though Numitor was the bigger brother, he does not seem
to have been, pugilistically speaking, the better man, for he was
deprived of the kingdom by Amulius, who, to prevent the chances of
the law of primogeniture again taking effect, by placing any of
Numitor's descendants on the throne, caused Rhea Silvia, the only
daughter of that individual to become a virgin in the Temple of Vesta.
The Vestals were, in fact, the old original nuns, withdrawing themselves
from the world, and entering into a solemn vow against marriage during
thirty years; after which period they were free to wed, though they
were scarcely ever invited to avail themselves of their rather tardy
privilege. The senior sister went by the highly respectable name of
Virgo Maxima&mdash;or old maid in chief&mdash;and was doubtless something
more than ordinary in her appearance, as well as in her position. The
Vestals were required to be plain in their dress, and in order to extend
this plainness as far as possible to their looks, their hair was cut very
short, however much they may have been distressed at parting with
their tresses. Their chief duty consisted in keeping up the fire on the
altar of Vesta, and they were prohibited on pain of death from giving
to any other flame the smallest encouragement. In the event of such
an offence having been committed by an unfortunate Vestal, who found
her position little better than being buried alive, she was made to
undergo literally that awful penalty.</p>

<p>Though the duties of the Vestals were rigidly enforced, and the
letting out of the sacred fire was, in some cases, punished by the
extinction of the delinquent's vital spark, they enjoyed some peculiar
advantages. Though their acts were under strict control, they were,
in one sense, allowed a will of their own; for they were permitted, even
when under age, to make their own testaments. They occupied reserved
seats at public entertainments; and if they happened to meet a
criminal in custody, they had the privilege of releasing him from the
hands of the police of the period. Notwithstanding these inducements,
the office of Vestal was not in much request; and, in the event of a
vacancy, it was awarded by lot to some young lady, whose dissatisfaction
with her lot was usually very visible. Such is a brief outline of the
duties and liabilities of the order into which Amulius forced his niece,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and it has been the subject of complaint in more recent times that
Rome still occasionally does as Rome used to do. We will now return
to Rhea Silvia, who appears to have entered the service of the goddess
as a maid-of-all-work; for she was in the habit of going to draw water
from a well; and it was on one of these aquatic excursions she met
with a military man, passing himself off as Mars who paid his addresses
to her, and proved <a name="irresistible" id="irresistible"></a>irresistible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 415px;">
<img src="images/i_p0004.png" width="415" height="500" alt="Rhea Silvia." title="" />
<span class="caption">Rhea Silvia.</span>
</div>

<p><br />Rhea Silvia gave birth to twins; upon which her cruel uncle ordered
her to be put to death, and desired that her infant offspring should be
treated as a couple of unwelcome puppies, and got rid of by drowning in
the ordinary manner.</p>

<p>The children were placed in a cradle, or, as some say, a bowl, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
turned adrift on the river; so that Amulius, if he had any misgiving
as to the security of his crown, preferred to drown it in the bowl with
his unhappy little relatives.</p>

<p>It happened that there had been such a run on the banks of the
Tiber, that its coffers or coffer-dams had poured out their contents all
over the adjacent plains, and caused a very extensive distribution of its
currency. Among other valuable deposits, it chanced to lodge for
security, in a branch connected with the bank, the children of Rhea
Silvia, who, by the way, must have been very fortunate under the
circumstances, in being able to keep a balance. The infants were not
in a very enviable condition; for there was nobody to board and lodge
them, though the Tiber was still at hand to wash and do for them.
The high tide proved a tide of good fortune to the children, who were
floated so far inland, that when the river receded, they were left high
and dry at the foot of a fig<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> tree, with no one, apparently, to care a fig
what became of them. Under these circumstances a she-wolf, who had
gone down to the Tiber to drink, heard the whimpering of the babies
among the trees, and, her attention being drawn off from the water in the
river to the whine in the wood, she came forward in the most handsome
manner in the capacity of a wet-nurse to give them suck and succour.
How this wolf became possessed of so much of the milk of human
kindness, does not appear, and it is not perhaps worth while to inquire.</p>

<p>The children, it is said, were awakened by receiving a gentle licking
from the tongue of the animal standing <i>in loco parentis</i> over them.
Finding the situation damp, the wolf removed the infants to her den,
where they were visited by a philanthropic woodpecker; who, when they
were hungry, would bring them some tempting grub, or worm, by
which the woodpecker soon wormed itself into the children's confidence.
Other members of the feathered tribe made themselves useful in this
novel nursery, by keeping off the insects; and many a gnat found itself&mdash;or
rather lost itself&mdash;unexpectedly in the throat of some remorseless
swallow. However well-meaning the animal may have been, the children
could not have profited greatly, if there had been no one ready to take
them from the month; and happily Faustulus, the king's shepherd, who
had watched them as they were being carried to the wolf's cave or loup-hole,
provided them with another loophole to get out of it. Taking
advantage of the wolf's temporary absence from home, the "gentle
shepherd," resolving to rescue the children, by hook or by crook, removed
the babes to his own hut, and handed them over to his wife Laurentia,
as a sort of supplement to their previously rather extensive family.</p>

<p>Some historians, refusing to believe the story of the Wolf and the
Woodpecker, have endeavoured to reconcile probability with tradition,
by suggesting that the wife of Faustulus had got the name of the Wolf
from the contrast she presented to her lamb-like husband, and that the
supposed woodpecker was simply a hen-pecker, in the person of Laurentia.</p>

<p>Romulus and Remus were the names of the two infants, who, as they
grew up, began to take after their foster-mother the wolf, turning out
exceedingly wild lads, with a lupine propensity for worrying the flocks,
and going on altogether in a very brutal manner. Remus was taken up
on a charge of sheep stealing, or something very like it, and brought
before Numitor, his own grandfather, when a recognition took place in
a manner not much in accordance with the ordinary rules of evidence.
Romulus had also been apprised of his relationship by Faustulus, who
must have made a pretty bold guess at a fact he could not have known;
and the two lads, being adopted by Numitor, were sent for their education
to Gabii, where everything was taught that men of rank in those days
were expected to learn, and whence the word Gaby is clearly derivable.
Anxious to do something for the old gentleman, their grandfather,
Romulus and Remus got up a demonstration in his favour, and they
succeeded in restoring him to the throne of Alba Longa, a long row of
white houses, which was less of a territory than a Terrace, and it is a
strange coincidence that Terracina, or little Terrace, formed one end of
it. Amulius was killed, and leaving Numitor sole master of White's
Row, Romulus and Remus resolved on a building speculation a great
deal higher up&mdash;that is to say on the spot where they had passed the
days of their infancy. Before the new city was commenced, a dispute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
arose, first, about what it should be called, and secondly, as to who
should govern it. Romulus and Remus, being twins, could not bring
the law of primogeniture to bear upon their little differences, and it was
therefore agreed to refer the matter to augury, which should decide who
was to be inaugurated as the ruler of the new colony. Romulus mounted
the Palatine Mount, and Remus took his station on the Aventine, when
both began to keep a very sharp look out for something ominous.
Remus was the first to remark something odd in the shape of six
vultures flying from north to south, but Romulus no sooner heard the
news than he declared he had seen twelve, and the question arose
whether, figuratively speaking, the one bird in hand seen by Remus
should outweigh the two in the bush that subsequently appeared to
Romulus. The augur, when appealed to, gave, as usual, a very ambiguous
answer. It amounted, in effect, to the observation that there were
six of one and a dozen of the other; so that the soothsayer, instead
of having said anything to soothe, was far more likely to irritate.
Both parties claimed the victory; Remus contending for the precedence
usually granted to the early bird, and Romulus maintaining that he had
been specially favoured, by having been permitted to see so many birds
of a feather flock together.
<img src="images/i_p0007a.png" width="40%" style="float: right;" alt="Remus jumping over the Walls" title=""/>
Romulus accordingly commenced drawing
his plans in the Etruscan fashion, by causing a boundary line to be
marked out with a plough, to which were yoked a heifer and a bull, a
ceremony from which, perhaps, the English term bulwarks, and the
French word boulevards or bulvards, may or may not be derivable. The
line thus traced was called the Pom&#339;rium, and where an entrance was
to be made, it was customary to carry the plough across the space&mdash;a
little engineering difficulty that gave the name of Porta to a
gate, from the verb <i>portare</i>, to
carry.
Remus looked on at the
proceedings in a half-quizzing,
half-quarrelsome spirit, until the
wall rose a little above the
ground, when he amused himself
by leaping derisively over
it. "Thus," said he, "will the
enemy leap over those barriers."
"And thus," rejoined the superintendent
or clerk of the works&mdash;one
Celer, who acted in this instance
with thoughtless celerity&mdash;"thus
shall die whoever may
leap over my barriers."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> With these words he gave Remus a mortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
blow, and the legend goes on to state, that Romulus was immediately
seized with remorse, and subsequent visits from his brother's ghost
rendered Romulus himself little better than the ghost of what he used
to be. Remus showed as much spirit after his decease as during his
lifetime; and took the form of the deadly nightshade, springing up at
the bed-side, to poison the existence of his brother.</p>

<span class="caption">Awful appearance of the Shade of Remus to Romulus.</span><br />
</div>

<p><br />Tradition tells us that Romulus came at length to terms with
the ghost, who agreed to discontinue his visits, in consideration of
the establishment of the festival of the Lemuria&mdash;called, originally,
Remuria&mdash;in honour of his memory. The rites were celebrated bare-footed&mdash;an
appropriate penalty for one who had stepped into a brother's
shoes; the hands were thrice washed&mdash;a process much needed, as
a sort of expiation for dirty work;&mdash;and black beans were thrown
four times behind the back, with the superstitious belief that the

spirits. The unfortunate twin was buried on Mount Aventine, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Romulus ordered a double set of sceptres, crowns, and royal
badges, in order that he might set up one set by the side of
his own, in honour of his late relative. These duplicates of mere
senseless symbols served only to commemorate the double part which
Romulus had acted; for a vacant throne and a headless crown were but
empty tributes to a murdered brother's memory.</p>

<p>The city having been built, was found considerably too large for the
people there were to live in it; and as a place cannot, like a garment,
be made to fit by taking it in, there was no alternative but to fill the
city with any stuff that might serve for stuffing. Romulus, therefore,
threw open his gates to any one who chose to walk in, which caused an
influx of those who, from having no character at all, usually go under
the denomination of all sorts of characters. Society became terribly
mixed, and, in fact, the place was a kind of Van Demon's Land,
crammed with criminals, replete with runaway slaves, and forming&mdash;in
a word&mdash;a regular refuge for the morally destitute. It says something
for the females of the period, that women were very scarce at Rome,
and it is surprising that some learned philologist has never yet made
the remark, that the fact of the word Ro-man being familiar to us
all, while there is no such term as Ro-woman, may be taken as a
collateral proof of the scarcity of the gentler sex in the city founded
by Romulus.</p>

<p>The ladies of the neighbourhood were indisposed to listen to the
addresses of the male population of Rome, which was quite bad enough
to suggest the possibility of the Latin word <i>male-factor</i> having supplied
the distinctive epithet "male" to the ruder sex in general. In vain
were proposals of marriage made to the maidens of the adjoining states,
who one and all declared they would not change their state by becoming
the wives of Romans. Irritated by these refusals, Romulus determined
to prove himself more than a match for these women, every one of
whom thought herself too good a match for any of his people.
He announced his intention to give a party or pic-nic for the
celebration of the Consualia, which were games in honour of Consus,
the god of Counsel,&mdash;a sort of lawyer's frolic, in which a mole was
sacrificed, probably because working in the dark was always the
characteristic of the legal fraternity. Invitations to these games were
issued in due form to the Latins and Sabines, with their wives and
daughters, many of whom flocked to the spot, under the influence of
female <a name="curiosity" id="curiosity"></a>curiosity.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">The Romans walking off with the Sabine Women.</span><br /><br />
</div>

<p>The weather being propitious, all the Sabine beauty and fashion were
attracted to the place, and the games, consisting of horse-racing, gave to
the scene all the animation of a cup day at Ascot. Suddenly, at a preconcerted
signal, there was a general elopement of the Roman youth with
the Sabine ladies, who were, in the most ungallant manner, abandoned
to their fate by the Sabine gentlemen. It is true that the latter were
taken by surprise, but they certainly made the very best of their way
home before they thought of avenging the wrong and insult that had
been committed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Had they been all married ladies who were carried
off, the cynic might have suggested that the Sabine husbands would not
have objected to a cheap mode of divorce, but&mdash;to make use of an
Irishism&mdash;there was only one single woman who happened to be a wife
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
in the whole of the "goodly company." The small Latin states,
Antennæ, Crustumerium, and C&#339;nina, were very angry at the supineness
of the Sabines, whose King&mdash;one Tatius&mdash;seemed disposed to
take the thing rather too tacitly. The three states above mentioned
commenced an action on their own account, and Acron, the King of
C&#339;nina, fell in battle by the hand of Romulus, who, stripping off the
apparel of the foe, caused it to be carried to Rome and hung upon an
oak, where the arms and armour of Acron, glittering among the acorns,
were dedicated, as <i>Spolia opima</i>, to Jupiter Feretrius.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Though Tatius had been the last, he was not destined to be the least
of those taking part in the Sabine war; and he determined to rely less
on strategy than stratagem. The water in those days was not so well
laid on as in later times; when the lofty aqueducts, still running in
ruins about the neighbourhood of Rome, were carried to an elevation
fitted for the very highest service that could be desired. Rome, instead
of being well supplied, was supplied by wells; and ladies of rank were
accustomed to draw the water required for domestic purposes. It
chanced, one afternoon, that Tarpeia, the daughter of Tarpeius, the
commander of the Roman city, on the Capitoline Hill, was proceeding
on an errand of the sort, when she met with Tatius, who, addressing her
in the language of a friend, requested "a drink" of her pitcher.
Tarpeia, dazzled by the splendour of his gold bracelets and glittering
armour, could not resist the request of such a highly polished gentleman.
Tatius had purposely electrotyped himself for the interview, and,
seeing the effect he had produced, he intimated that he had several
friends, who were covered with metal quite as attractive as that he
wore, and that, if Tarpeia would only open the gate of the citadel to
himself and party, she should have more gold than she could carry.
The bargain was faithfully kept on both sides; for Tarpeia opened the
gate to Tatius and the Sabines, who, on their part performed their
contract to the letter, for, as they entered, they threw at her not only
their bracelets but their breast-plates, completely crushing her with the
weight of the gold she had coveted; and making her think, no doubt,
that "never was poor woman so unmercifully put upon." So thorough
an illustration of an <i>embarras des richesses</i> is not often met with
in history.</p>

<p>Being now possessed of the Capitoline, the Sabines were in an
improved position; and the Romans, having tried in vain to recover
the citadel, saw that they must either give in or give battle. Determining
on the latter course, Romulus selected the valley between the
Palatine and the Capitoline, where a general engagement began; but
the Romans seemed to have special engagements elsewhere, for they
were all running away, when their leader, with great tact, vowed a
Temple to Jupiter Stator&mdash;the flight-stayer. This gave to the action
a decided re-action; for the Romans, being rallied upon their cowardice,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
by their chief, began, in their turn, to rally. The contest grew
fierce on both sides, when suddenly the Sabine ladies, who were the
primary cause of the quarrel, threw themselves into the midst;
and, though female interference has rarely the effect of making peace,
the women were, on this occasion, the cause of a cessation of
hostility. It was agreed that the two nations should be henceforth
united under the name of Romans and Quirites, each having a distinct
king, a distinction which, had it continued, must in time have led to a
difference. In a few years, however, Tatius was slain at a sacrifice
which he had attended without the remotest idea of being made a
victim himself; and Romulus, finding nothing said about a successor,
thought it politic to hush the matter up without even avenging his late
colleague. Romulus is said to have reigned for seven-and-thirty years;
but when we enquire into the exact time and manner of his death we
learn nothing, beyond the fact that nobody knows what became of him.
According to the statement of one set of authorities, he was attending
a review in the Palus Capræ--a marsh near the Tiber--when a total
eclipse of the sun took place, and on the return of light, Romulus was
nowhere visible. If this was really the case, it is probable that he got
into a perilous swamp, where he felt a rapid sinking; and all his
attendants being in the dark as to his situation were unable to extricate
him from the marsh in which, according to some authorities, he went
down to posterity.

It must, however, be confessed, that when we look for the cause of
the death of Romulus in this fatal swamp, we have but very poor
ground to go upon. It is, nevertheless, some consolation to us for the
mystery that overhangs the place and manner of his decease, that his
existence is, after all, quite apocryphal; and we are not expected to go
into an elaborate inquiry when, where, and how he died, until the fact
of his having ever lived at all has been satisfactorily settled.

Before we have quite done with Romulus, it will be proper to state
how he is said to have divided the people under his sovereignty. He
is alleged to have separated them into three tribes--the Latin word
<i>tribus</i> will here suggest itself to the acute student--namely the Ramnes,
called after the Romans; the Tities, after Titus Tatius; and the Luceres,
who derived their appellation either from one Lucumo, an Etruscan
ally of Romulus, or Lucerus a king of Ardea; or <i>lucus</i> a grove, because
there was no grove, and hence we get <i>lucerus a non luco</i>, on the same
principle as <i>lucus a non lucendo</i>: or lastly, according to Niebuhr's
opinion, from a place called Lucer or Lucerum, which the Luceres
might have inhabited.

Each tribe was divided into ten <i>curiæ</i>,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> every one of which had a
chapel for the performance of sacred rites, and was presided over by a
<i>curio</i>; and the reader must have little curiosity, indeed, if he does not
ask whether our modern word curate may not be referred to this remote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
origin. The <i>curiæ</i> were subdivided into gentes, or clans, and each gens
consisted of several families, called gentiles; so that a man of family
and a member of the gentes, became somewhat synonymous. In time,
however, the gentiles got very much mixed by unsuitable marriages;
and hence there arose among those who could claim to belong to a gens,
a distinction similar to that between the <i>gentes</i>, or <i>gents</i>, of our own day,
and the <i>gentiles</i>, or <i>gentlemen</i>. Romulus is said to have selected his
body-guard from the three tribes, taking one hundred from each, and as
Celer, the Etruscan, was their captain, the guards got the name of
Celeres&mdash;the fast men of the period.</p>

<p>In addition to the tribes, there existed in those early times a separate
body, consisting of slaves, and a somewhat higher class, called by the
name of clients.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The latter belonged to the common people, each of
whom was permitted to choose from among the patricians a <i>patronus</i>,
or patron, who could claim the life and fortune of his client in exchange
for the cheaper commodities of protection and patronage. The patron
gave his countenance and advice when asked, the client giving his
labour and his money when wanted&mdash;an arrangement which proves that
clients, from the remotest times to the present hour, were liable to
pecuniary mulcts, even to the extent of the entire sacrifice of the whole
of their subsistence, for the benefit of those who had the privilege
of advising them.</p>

<p>The Senate&mdash;a term derived from the Latin word <i>Senes</i>, old men&mdash;formed
the chief council of the state, and its first institution is usually
referred to the reign of Romulus. Three members were nominated by
each tribe, and three by each of the thirty <i>curiæ</i>, making ninety-nine
in all, to which Romulus himself is said to have added one, for the purpose
of making up round numbers, and at the same time nominating a
sort of president over the assembly, who also had to take care of the city,
in the absence of the sovereign. There is a difference of opinion as to
whether one hundred new members were added to the Senate at the time
of the union with the Sabines, for Dionysius says there were; but Livy
says there were not; and we are disposed to attach credit to the former,
for he was an extremely particular man, while Livy was frequently
oblivious of caution in giving credence and currency to mere tradition.</p>

<p>Before closing this portion of the narrative of the History of Rome, it
is necessary to warn the reader against believing too much of it. The
current legends are, indeed, <i>Legenda</i>, or things to be read, because every
body is in the habit of repeating them; but the student must guard
himself against placing credence in the old remark, that "what everybody
says must be true," for here is a direct instance of what everybody
says being decidedly otherwise. The life and reign of Romulus, are to
be taken not simply <i>cum grano salis</i>&mdash;with a grain of salt&mdash;but with
an entire cellar of that condiment, which is so useful in correcting the
evil consequences of swallowing too much of anything.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>FROM THE ACCESSION OF NUMA POMPILIUS TO THE DEATH OF ANCUS<br />

</div>
<p><span style="margin-left:-1em;" class="smcap">omulus</span> having been swamped in the marsh of
Capra, or having disappeared down one of
those drains, which have carried away into the
great sea of conjecture so many of the facts of
former ages, the senate put off from week to
week, and from this day se'nnight to that day
se'nnight the choice of a successor. The
honourable members agreed to try their hands
at Government by turns, and they took the
sceptre for five days each by a constant rotation,
which any wheel, and more particularly
a commonwheal, was sure to suffer from. The
people growing tired of this unprofitable game
of fives, which threw everything into a state
of sixes and sevens, clamoured so loudly to be
reduced under one head, that permission was
given them to elect a sovereign. Their choice
fell upon Numa Pompilius, because he was
born on the day of the foundation of the city;
so that he may be said to have succeeded by
birth to the berth of chief magistrate. Numa
Pompilius was a Sabine, who we are told had
been instructed by Pythagoras, and we should
be happy to believe what we are told, if we did
not happen to know that the sage belonged to
quite a different time, having lived two hundred
years later than the alleged existence of the pupil.</p>

<p>Before entering on his duties, the newly chosen king consulted the
augurs, with one of whom he walked up to the Temple on the Saturnian
Hill, where Numa, seated on a stone, looked to the south as far as he
could see, in order to ascertain whether there was any impediment to
his views and prospects. In the earliest periods of the history of Rome
no office was undertaken without a consultation of the augurs, or
auspices; and the continued use of these words affords proof of the
ancient custom to which they relate; though inauguration now takes
place under auspices of a very different character. The recognised
signs of those times were only two, consisting of the lightning, by
means of which the truth was supposed to flash across the augur's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
mind; and, secondly, the birds, who, by being consulted for something
singular in their singing, or eccentric in their flying, might, had they
known it, have fairly plumed themselves on the honours done to them.
A crow on the left betokened that things were looking black, but the
same bird on the right imparted to everything a brighter colour; and as
these birds are in the habit of wandering right and left, the augurs could
always declare there was something to be said on both sides.</p>

<p>Numa Pompilius was, according to all accounts, a just ruler, and he
began his career in a ruler-like manner by drawing several straight
lines about Rome, to mark its boundaries. He placed these under a
deity, termed Terminus, and he erected twelve stones within a stone's
throw of each other, at regular intervals along the frontier. These
were visited once a year by twelve officers, called Fratres Arvales,
appointed for the purpose, and the custom originated, no doubt, the
parochial practice of perambulating parishes with wands and staves,
placed in the hands of beadles, who not unfrequently add the luxury
of beating the boys to the ceremony of beating the boundaries.<br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_p0015.png" width="500" height="297" alt="" title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">Numa Pompilius remembering the Grotto.</span><br /><br /></div>

<p>Numa, though he had come to the throne, was fond of the retired
walks of life, and frequently took a solitary stroll in the suburbs.
During one of his rambles chance brought him to a grotto, and he was
induced to remember the grotto by the surpassing loveliness of its fair
inhabitant. Her name was Egeria, her profession that of a fortune-teller,
which gave her such an influence over the superstitious mind of
Numa, that she ruled him with her divining rod as completely as if it
had been a rod of iron. He professed to act under the advice of this
nymph, to whom tradition&mdash;an inveterate match-maker&mdash;has married
him, and he instituted the Flamines, an order of priests, to give weight
to the falsehoods or "flams" he thought fit to promulgate. The
privileges of the Flamines were not altogether of the most comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
kind, and consisted chiefly in the right of wearing the Apex&mdash;a cap made
of olive wood&mdash;and the Laena, a sort of Roman wrap-rascal, shaggy on
both sides, and worn above the toga, as an overcoat. The Flamen was
prohibited from appearing in public without his Apex, which could not
be kept on the head without strings; but such was the stringency of
the regulations, that one Sulpicius<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> was deprived of his priesthood, in
consequence of his official hat, which was as light as a modern zephyr,
having been blown off his head in the midst of a sacrifice.</p>

<p>Numa added, also, a sort of <i>ballet</i> company to the mythological
arrangements of his day, by establishing twelve <i>Salii</i>, or dancing priests,
whose duty it was to execute a grand <i>pas de douze</i> on certain occasions
through the principal public thorough fares. The Salii, though a highly
respectable, were not a very venerable order, for no one could remain in
it whose father and mother were not both alive, the existence of the
parents of the dancing priests being, no doubt, required as a guarantee
that their dancing days were not yet over.</p>

<p>Several temples are dated from this reign, including that of Janus,
the double-faced deity, who presided over peace and war&mdash;a most
appropriate office to one capable of looking two ways at once, for there
are always two sides to every quarrel. This temple must have been
perfectly useless during the life of its founder, for it was never to
be opened in the time of peace, and Numa preserved for Rome
forty-three years of undisturbed tranquillity. He was emphatically
the friend of order, and its usual consequences, prosperity to trade,
with soundness of credit, and he encouraged commerce by giving a
patron-saint or Lar to every industrial occupation. He marked also the
value of good faith by building a temple to Bona Fides, and it may be
presumed that the creditor, who, putting up with the loss of his little
bill, sacrificed a bad debt in this Temple, was still in hope that he should
eventually find his account in it.</p>

<p>If it cannot be said that Numa never lost a day, it must be admitted
that he made the most of his time; for he added two whole months to
the year of Romulus. January and February were the names given
to the time thus gained; but as the year did not then correspond with
the course of the sun, it was usual to introduce, every other year, a
supplementary month, so that if one year was too short, the next, by
being too long, made it as broad as it was long in the aggregate.</p>

<p>Numa Pompilius lived to be eighty-two; when he had the beatitude of
dying as peacefully as he had lived; and so gently had Nature dealt
with him, that she had suffered him to run up more than four scores,
before her debt was satisfied. Certain stories are told of the funeral
ceremonies that followed Numa's death; and it is said that the Senators
acted as porters to his bier, in token of their appreciation of the imperial
measures which Numa had himself carried. It has been stated, also,
that he caused to be placed, within his tomb, a copy, on papyrus, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
palm leaves,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> of his own works, in twenty-four books; and it is certainly
a happy idea to bury an author with his writings, when, if they have
been provocative of sleep in others, he may eventually reap the benefit
of their somniferous properties.</p>

<p>On the death of Numa, the country having been taught, by past
experience, the danger of allowing the crown to go from head to head,
without the slightest regard to a fit, determined that the interregnum
should be short, and the election of a new king was at once proceeded
with. The choice fell upon Tullus Hostilius, who was of a decidedly
warlike turn, and was ever on the look-out for a pretext to commence
hostilities. The Albans, our old friends of Alba Longa, or White's
Row, were the nearest, and consequently the most conveniently situated,
for the indulgence of his pugnacious propensities; and tradition relates
that on one occasion some Alban peasants, having been attacked and
stripped by the Romans, the former, who had lost even their clothes,
sought redress at the hands of their rulers. In the course of an
attempt to settle the dispute between Alba and Rome, each place sent
ambassadors, who crossed each other on the road, as if the two states
were determined to be in every way at cross purposes. The Alban
envoys were beguiled of all ideas of business by invitations to banquets
and feasts, so that whenever they attempted to ask for explanations,
their mouths were stopped with a dinner or a supper, given in honour
of their visit. The Roman messengers were prohibited, on the contrary,
from accepting invitations, or giving up to parties what was
meant for Romankind; and had received peremptory instructions to
demand an immediate settlement of their long-standing account from the
Albans. The parties could not
understand each other, or, rather,
they understood each other too
well; for war was the object of
both, though neither of them
liked the responsibility of beginning
it. The Albans, however,
prepared to march on Rome,
and encamped themselves within
the confines of a ditch, into
which ditch their King, Cluilius,
tumbled, one night, very mysteriously,
and died, which caused
them to dignify the ditch with
the name of <i>fossa <a name="Cluilia" id="Cluilia"></a>Cluilia</i>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_p0017.png" width="300" height="290" alt="Death of Cluilius." title="" />
<span class="caption">Death of Cluilius.</span>
</div>
<p>The Albans appointed one Mettius
Fuffetius, a fussy and nervous
personage, as Dictator, in the place of the late King; and Fuffetius
requested an interview with Tullus, who agreed to the proposition, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
a determination, before meeting the Dictator, not to be dictated to.
Mettius represented the inconvenience of wasting whole rivers of blood,
when a few pints might answer all the purpose; and it was finally
agreed to settle the matter by a grand combat of six, sustained on either
side by three champions, chosen from each army. The Alban and the
Roman forces were graced, respectively, with a trio of brothers, whose
strength and activity rendered them worthy to be ranked with the
small family parties who attach the epithet of Herculean, Acrobatic,
Indian rubber, or Incredible, to the fraternal character in which they
come forward to astonish and amuse the enlightened age we live in.</p>

<p>These six young men were known as the Horatii and Curiatii,&mdash;the
former being on the Roman, the latter on the Alban side; and to them
it was agreed, by mutual consent, to trust the fate of the battle. The
story-tellers have done their utmost to render everything Roman as
romantic as possible; and the legend of the Horatii and Curiatii has
been heightened by making one of the latter batch of brothers the
accepted lover of the sister of the Horatii.</p>

<p>All the arrangements for the sanguinary <i>sestetto</i> having been completed,
the six champions came forward, looking fresh and confident,
not one of them displaying nervousness by a shaking of the hand,
though they shook each other's hands very heartily. Having taken
their positions, the men presented a picture which we regret has not
been preserved for us by some sporting annalist of the period. Imagination,
who is "our own reporter" on this occasion, and, perhaps, as
accurate a reporter as many who profess to chronicle passing events,
must fill up the outlines of the sketch that has been handed down to us.</p>

<p>The contest commenced with a great deal of that harmless, but
violent exercise, which goes on between Shakspeare's celebrated pair of
Macs&mdash;the well known 'Beth and 'Duff&mdash;when the former requests the
latter to "lay on" to him, and there ensues a clashing of their swords,
as vigorous as the clashing of their claims to the crown of Scotland.
At length one of the Curiatii, feeling that they had all met for the
despatch of business, despatched one of the Horatii, upon which the
combatants, being set going, they continued to go one by one with great
rapidity. A few seconds had scarcely elapsed when a second of the
Horatii fell, and the survivor of the trio, thinking that he must eventually
become number three if he did not speedily take care of number
one, resolved to stop short this run of ill-luck against his race, by
attempting a run of good luck for his life; or, in other words, having a
race for it. The excellence of his wind saved him from drawing his
last breath, for the Curiatii, starting off in pursuit, soon proved unequal
in their speed, and one shot far in advance of the other two, who, though
stout of heart, were somewhat too stout of body to be as forward as
their nimbler brother in giving chase to their antagonist. The survivor
of the Horatii perceiving this, turned suddenly round upon the nearest
of his foes, and having at once disposed of him, waited patiently for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
other two, who were coming at unequal speed, puffing and panting after
him. A single blow did for the second of the Curiatii, who was already
blown by the effort of running, and it was unnecessary to do more with
the third, who came up completely out of breath, than to render him
incapable of taking in a further supply of that vitally important article.
The last of the Horatii had consequently become the conqueror, and
though when he began to run his life seemed to hang on a thread,
which an unlucky stitch in his side would have finished off, his flight
was the cause of his coming off in the end with flying colours. After
the first of the Curiatii fell, fatness proved fatal to the other two, for
Horatius, by dealing with them <i>en gros</i>, as well as <i>en detail</i>, settled all
accounts with both of <a name="them" id="them"></a>them.</p>

<span class="caption">Combat between the Horatii and Curiatii.</span><br /><br />
</div>

<p>Seeing the result of the contest, Fuffetius, on the part of the Albans,
gave out that they gave in, and the Romans returned home with
Horatius at their head, carrying&mdash;in a huge bundle&mdash;the spoils of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Curiatii. At the entrance of the city he met his sister, who, perceiving
among the spoils, a garment of her late lover, embroidered with a piece
of work from her own hands, commenced another piece of work of a
most frantic and desperate character. Maddened at the sight of the
yarn she had spun for the lost object of her affections, she began
spinning another yarn that threatened to be interminable, if her
brother had not soon cut the thread of it. She called him by all kinds
of names but his own, and was, in fact, as noisy and abusive as a
conventional "female in distress," or, as that alarming and dangerous
nuisance, "an injured woman." Horatius, who had found the blades
of three assailants less cutting than a sister's tongue, interrupted her as
she ran through her wrongs, by running her through with his sword,
accompanying the act with the exclamation, "Thus perish all the
enemies of Rome." Notwithstanding the excitement and <i>éclat</i> attending
the triumphant entry of Horatius into Rome, the proper officer of the
period, whoever he may have been, was evidently not only on duty, but
prepared to do it, for the victorious fratricide, or sororicide, was at once
hurried off to the nearest Roman station. Having been taken before
the king, his majesty saw great difficulties in the case, and was puzzled
how to dispose of it. Taking out the scales of justice, he threw the
heavy crime of Horatius into one; but the services performed for his
country, when cast into the other scale, seemed to balance the matter
pretty evenly. Tullus, therefore, referred the case to another tribunal,
which sentenced the culprit to be hanged, but he was allowed to have so
capitally acquitted himself in the fight, that he was acquitted of the
capital punishment. This was commuted for the penalty of passing
under the yoke, which consisted of the ceremony of walking under a
pike raised upright on two others, and at these three pikes the only
toll placed upon his crime was levied.</p>

<p>The fallen warriors were honoured with tombs in the form of sugar-loaves,
by which the unsatisfactory sweets of posthumous renown were
symbolised. Fuffetius, who though not wounded in his person, was
fearfully wounded in his pride by the result of the conflict, felt so
jealous of Tullus, that the former, though afraid to burst into open
revolt, determined on the really more revolting plan of treachery. The
rival soldiers had now to combine their forces against the Veientines and
the Fidenates, and, having set out together, they soon found the foe drawn
up in battle array, when Tullus with his Romans faced the Veientines,
and Mettius with his Albans formed a <i>vis à vis</i> to the Fidenates. When
the conflict commenced, the Alban wing showed the white feather, and
Fuffetius gradually withdrew his forces to an adjacent hill, which he
lowered himself by ascending for the purpose of watching the turn of
events, so that he might declare himself on the side of victory. Tullus
saw the unmanly man&#339;uvre, but winked at it, and rushed like winking
upon the Fidenates, who ran so fast that their discretion completely
out-ran their valour. The Roman leader then turned his eyes, arms,
and legs towards the Veientines, who fled towards the Tiber, into which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
they desperately dived, but many of them, for divers reasons, never got
out again. The perfidious Albans, headed by Mettius Fuffetius, now came
down into the plain, and putting on a plain, straightforward manner, he
congratulated Tullus on the victory. Pretending not to have noticed
their treachery, he invited them all to a sacrifice on the following day,
and having particularly requested them to come early, they were on the
ground by sunrise, but were completely in the dark as to the intentions
of T. Hostilius. The Romans at a given signal closed in upon the
Albans, who were informed that their city should be razed, or rather,
lowered to the ground, and, that their chief, who had pulled a different
way from his new ally, should be fastened to horses who should be
driven in opposite directions. This cruel sentence, upon which we have
scarcely patience to bestow a sentence of our own, was barbarously
carried into execution. Alba fell to the ground; which is all we have
been able to pick up relating to the subject of this portion of our history.</p>

<p>The remainder of the reign of Hostilius was occupied with military
successes; but he neglected the worship of the gods, who it is said
evinced their anger by a tremendous shower of stones on the Alban
Mount, in order to soften his flinty heart, by making him feel the weight
of their displeasure. From the extreme of indifference he went to
the opposite extreme of superstition, and called upon Jupiter to send
him a sign&mdash;which was, in fact, a sign of the King's head being in a
lamentable condition. The unhappy sovereign, imitating his predecessor
Numa, attempted some experiments in the hope of drawing down some
lightning, but it was not likely that one who had conducted himself so
badly could be a better conductor of the electric fluid, and the result
was, that though he learned the art of attracting the spark, it flashed
upon him with such force that he instantly expired.</p>

<p>Such is the tradition with reference to the death of Tullus; but it is
hard to say whether the accounts handed down to us have been overcharged,
or whether the clouds were in that condition. Some speculators
insinuate that the royal experimentalist owed his sad fate to some mismanagement
of his electrical jar while attempting to produce an
unnatural jarring of the elements. The good actions of Tullus were
so few, that his fame will not afford the omission of one, and being
desirous to put the best construction we can upon his works, we give
him credit for the construction of the Curia Hostilia, whose site still
meets the eye near the northern angle of the Palatine. Ambassadors
are spoken of as existing in the reign of Tullus Hostilius, but whether
they owe their origin to Numa, who went before, or to Ancus Martius,
who came after him, is so much a matter of doubt, that some historians,
in trying to meet the claims of both half-way, stop short of giving the
merit to either. Tullus may, at all events, have the credit of employing,
if he did not institute, the art of diplomacy in Rome; for he appointed
ambassadors, as we have already seen, to negotiate with the Albans.
These envoys were called Feciales, the chief of whom wore on his head
a fillet of white wool, with a quantity of green herbs, formed into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
turban, which must have had somewhat the appearance of a fillet of
veal, with the ingredients for stuffing. His duty was to proceed
to the offending country, and proclaim his wrongs upon the border,
though there might be no one there to listen, and having crossed
the boundary&mdash;if his indignation happened to know any bounds&mdash;he
was to astonish the first native he met by a catalogue of
grievances. On reaching a city, the ambassador went over the old
story to the soldier at the gate, just as though, at Storey's gate,
an irritated foreigner should pour out his country's real or imaginary
wrongs to the sentinel on duty. To this recital the soldier would,
of course, be as deaf as his post, and the Fecialis would then proceed
to lay his complaint before the magistrates. In the event of his
obtaining no redress, he returned home for a spear, and killing a pig
with one end, he poked the fire with the other. The instrument being
thus charred in the handle and blood-stained at the point, became an
appropriate emblem of hostility, and the Fecialis declared war by stirring
it up with the long pole, which he threw across the enemy's boundary.</p>

<p>After the death of Tullus Hostilius, the people lost no time in
choosing Ancus Martius, a grandson of Numa, for their sovereign.
The new king copied his grandfather, which he had a perfect right to
do, but he imposed on the Pontifex Maximus the very severe task of
copying on white tables the somewhat ponderous works of Pompilius,
which were posted up for the perusal of the populace.</p>

<p>Though partial on the whole to peace, Ancus was not afraid of war,
and, when his kingdom was threatened, he was quite ready to fight for
it. He subdued the Latins, and having first settled them in the field,
allowed them to settle themselves in the city. He enlarged Rome, but
abridged the distance between different parts by throwing the first
bridge across the Tiber, and his name has come down to posterity in the
ditch of the Quirites which he caused to be dug for the defence of the
city, against those who were unlikely to go through thick and thin for
the purpose of invading it. He also built a prison in the heart of the
city, and what might be truly termed a heart of stone, for the prison
was formed of a quarry, and is still in existence as a monument of the
hard lot of its inmates. Ancus Martius further signalised his reign by
founding the city of Ostia at the Tiber's mouth, and thus gave its
waters the benefit of that port which so much increased their value. On
the spot may still be seen some ruins supposed to belong to a temple
dedicated to the winds, among whom the greater part of the temple has
long since been promiscuously scattered. Salt-works were also
established in its neighbourhood, but the <i>sal</i> was of that volatile kind
that none now remains from which buyers could fill their cellars.
Ancus Martius reigned for a period of twenty-four years, and either in
tranquillity or war&mdash;whether engaged in the works of peace, or embroiled
in a piece of work&mdash;he proved himself thoroughly worthy of his
predecessors, and, in fact, he left far behind him many who had gone
before him in the task of government.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br />CHAPTER THE THIRD.</h2>

<h3>FROM THE ACCESSION OF TARQUINIUS PRISCUS TO THE DEATH OF<br />
SERVIUS TULLIUS.<br /><br /></h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 50px;">
<img src="images/i_p0023.png" width="50" height="100" alt="" title="" />
</div>


<p><span style="margin-left:-0.5em" class="smcap">It</span> is the opinion of the best authorities
that the Muse of History has employed
her skipping-rope in passing, or rather
skipping, from the grave of Ancus
Martius to the throne of Tarquinius
Priscus; for there is a very visible
gap yawning between the two; and as
we have no wish to set the reader
yawning in sympathy with the gap, we
at once drag him away from it.</p>

<p>Plunging into the times of Tarquinius
Priscus, we describe him as
the son of a Corinthian merchant, who,
being compelled to quit his country for
political reasons, had withdrawn all
his Corinthian capital, and settled at
Tarquinii, an Etruscan city. Having
fallen in love with a lady of the place,
or, more poetically speaking, deposited
his affections in an Etruscan
vase, he became a husband to her, and
the father of two children, named respectively
Lucumo and Aruns. Poor
Aruns had a very brief run, and soon
met his death; but we cannot say how
or where, for we have no report of the meeting. Lucumo married
Tanaquil, an Etruscan lady, of great beauty and ambition, who professed
to dive into futurity; and, guided by this diving belle, he threw himself
into the stream of events, in the hope of being carried onwards by the
tide of fortune. She persuaded him that Tarquinii was a poor place,
where nothing was to be done; that his foreign extraction prevented
him from being properly drawn out; and that Rome alone could afford
him a field wide enough for his vast abilities. Driven by his wife, he
jumped up into his chariot, which was an open one, and was just entering
Rome, when his cap was suddenly removed from his head by a
strange bird, which some allege was an eagle; though, had they said it
was a lark, we should have believed them far more readily. Lucumo
followed his hat as well as he could with his eyes; but his wife was so
completely carried away with it, that she declared the circumstance told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
her he would gain a crown, though it really proved how nearly he had
lost one; for until the bird replaced his hat upon his head, there was
only a bare possibility of his getting it back again.</p>

<p>The wealth of his wife enabled Lucumo to live in the first style of
fashion; and having been admitted to the rights of citizenship, he
changed his name to Lucius Tarquinius: for the sake, perhaps, of
the sound, in the absence of any sounder reason. He was introduced
at Court, where he won the favour of Ancus, who was so much taken
by his dashing exterior, that he gave him a commission in the army, as
Tribunus Celerum, a sort of Captain of the Guards, who, from the
title of Celeres, appear to have been, as we have before observed, the
fast men, as opposed to the "slow coaches" of the period.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_p0024.png" width="300" height="177" alt="Celeres." title="" />
<span class="caption">Celeres.</span>
</div>

<p>The Captain made himself so generally useful to Ancus, that when
the latter died, his two sons were left to the guardianship of the
former, who, on the day fixed for the election of a new king, sent his
wards to the chase, that they might be pursuing other game, instead of
looking after the Crown, which Tarquinius had set his own eye upon.
In the absence of the youths, Tarquinius, who had got the name of
Priscus, or the old hand, which he seems to have well deserved, proposed
himself as a candidate; and, in a capital electioneering speech,
put forth his own merits with such success, that he was voted on to the
throne without opposition.</p>

<p>The commencement of his reign was not very peaceful, for he was
attacked by the Latins; but he gave them a very severe Latin lesson,
and, crushing them under his feet, sent them back to that part of Italy
forming the lower part of the boot, with the loss of considerable booty.
He, nevertheless, found time for all manner of games; and he instituted
the Ludi Magni, which were great sport, in a space he marked out as
the Circus Maximus.</p>

<p>The position of the Circus was between the Palatine and Aventine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Hills, there being a slope on either side, so that the people followed the
inclination of nature as well as their own in selecting the spot for
spectacular purposes. In the earliest times a Circus was formed of
materials brought by the spectators themselves, who raised temporary
scaffolds, from which an unfortunate drop, causing fearful execution among
the crowd, would frequently happen. Tarquinius Priscus, desirous of giving
more permanent accommodation to the Roman sight seers, built a Circus
capable of containing 150,000 persons, and, from its vast superiority in
size over other similar buildings, it obtained the distinction of Maximus.
The sports of the Circus were extremely attractive to the Romans, who
looked to the <i>libelli</i>, containing the lists of the horses, and names and
colours of the drivers, with all the eagerness of a "gentleman sportsman"
seeking information from Dorling's correct card at Epsom. In
the early days of Rome the amusements of the Circus were limited to
the comparatively harmless contests of equestrian speed; and it was not
until the city had reached a high state of refinement&mdash;cruelty having
become refined like everything else&mdash;that animals were killed by
thousands, and human beings by hundreds at a time, to glut the
sanguinary appetites of the prince and the people. The ancient Circus
was circular at one end only, and the line of seats was broken by a sort
of outwork, supposed to have comprised the box and retiring-room of the
sovereign; while, at the opposite side, was another deviation from the
line of seats, to form a place for the <i>editor spectaculorum</i>&mdash;a box for
the manager. Though Tarquinius is said to have founded the Circus
Maximus in commemoration of his victory over the Latins, they were
not the only foes whom he might have boasted of vanquishing.</p>

<p>Having fought and conquered the Sabines, he took from them
Collatræ, as a collateral security for their good behaviour; and coming
home with a great deal of money, he built the Temple of Jupiter on the
capitol.</p>

<p>Tarquinius, being desirous of increasing the army, was opposed by a
celebrated augur of the day, one Attus Navius, whose reputation seems
to have been well deserved, if the annexed anecdote is to be believed;
for it indicates that he could see further into a whetstone than any one
who has either gone before or followed him. Navius declared that augury
must determine whether the plan of Tarquinius could be carried out,
which caused the latter to ask, sneeringly, whether he knew what he
was thinking about. The question was ambiguous, but Navius boldly
replied he did, and added, that what Tarquinius proposed to do was
perfectly possible. "Is it indeed," said the King, "I was thinking
of cutting through this whetstone with this razor." "It will be a close
shave," was the reply of the augur, "but it can be done, so cut away;"
and the bluntness of the observation was only equalled by the sharpness
of the blade, which cut the article in two as easily as if it had been
a pound of butter, instead of a stone of granite. This reproof was
literally more cutting than any other that could have been possibly
conveyed to the king, who ever afterwards paid the utmost respect to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the augurs, of whom he was accustomed thenceforth to say, that the
affair of the whetstone proved them to be much sharper blades than he
had been willing to take them for.</p>

<p>Having been at war with the Tuscans, whom he vanquished, he was
admitted into the ranks of the Kings of Etruria; a position which led
him to indulge in the most extravagant desires. He must needs have
a crown of gold, which often tears or encumbers the brow it adorns; a
throne of ivory, on whose too highly polished surface the foot is apt to
slip; and a sceptre, having on its top an eagle, which frequently gives
wings to the power it is intended to typify. His robe was of purple,
with so costly an edging, that the border exceeded all reasonable limits,
and furnished an instance of extravagance carried to the extreme,
while the rate at which he went on may be judged from the fact of his
always driving four in hand in his chariot. He did not, however,
wholly neglect the useful in his taste for the ornamental; and though
his extravagance must have been a drain upon the public pocket, he
devoted himself to the more honourable drainage of the lower portions
of the city. He set an example to all future commissioners of sewers,
by his great work of the <i>Cloaca Maxima</i>, some portion of which still
exists, and which contains, in its spacious vault, a far more honourable
monument than the most magnificent tomb that could have been raised
to his memory.</p>

<p>Tarquinius had reigned about thirty-eight years, when the sons of
Ancus Martius, who had been from the first brooding over their own
ejection from the throne, carried their brooding so far as to hatch a
conspiracy, which, though regarded by the best authorities as a mare's
nest, forms one of those "lays" of ancient Rome which tradition gives
as part of her history. The youths, expecting that Tarquinius would
secure the succession to a favourite, named Servius Tullius, made an
arrangement with a couple of shepherds, who, pretending to have a
quarrel, went with hatchets in their hands to the king, and requested
him to settle their little difference. Tarquinius seems to have been in
a most accommodating humour, for he is said to have stepped to the
door of the palace, to arbitrate between these most un-gentle shepherds,
who, pretending that they only came with their hatchets to axe his
advice, began to axe him about the head; and while he was endeavouring
to act as an arbitrator, they, acting as still greater traitors, cruelly
made away with him. The lictors who stood by must have had their
faces and their fasces turned the wrong way, for they administered a
beating to the shepherds when, too late, after the regal crown was
already cracked beyond the possibility of repair, and the king was
almost knocked to pieces before he had time to collect himself.</p>

<p>Tarquinius was a practical reformer, and rested his fame on the most
durable foundations, among which the still-existing remains of the
Cloaca Maxima, or largest common sewer, have already been noticed.
Those who are over nice might feel repugnant to come down to posterity
by such a channel; but that country is fortunate indeed in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
genius seeks "the bubble reputation" at the mouth of the sewer,
instead of in the mouth of the cannon.</p>

<p>It must be recorded, to the honour of Tarquinius, that he organised
the plebeians, and elevated some of them to the rank of patricians, thus
giving vigour to the aristocratic body, which runs the risk of becoming
corrupt, and losing its vitality, unless a supply of plebeian life-blood is
from time to time poured into it.</p>

<p>This measure would have been followed by other wholesome reforms,
but for the short-sighted and selfish policy of the patricians themselves,
who could not perceive the fact, full of apparent paradoxes, that if anything
is to remain, it must not stand still; that no station can be
stationary with safety to itself; and that nothing possessed of vitality
can grow old without something new being continually added.</p>

<p>The sixth king of Rome was Servius Tullius, who is said to have
been the son of a female in the establishment of Tanaquil. His
mother's name was Ocrisia; but there is something vague about the
paternity of the boy, which has been assigned sometimes to the Lar, or
household god of the establishment, and sometimes to Vulcan. Whoever
may have been the father, it was soon intimated that the child was
to occupy a high position; and on one occasion, when sleeping in his
cradle, his head was seen to be on fire; but no one was allowed to blow
out the poor boy's brains, or otherwise extinguish the flame, which
was rapidly consuming the hair on the head of the future heir to the
monarchy. The nurses and attendants were ordered to sit down and
see the fire burn out of its own accord, which, the tradition says, it did,
though common sense says it couldn't; for the unfortunate infant
must have died of consumption had he been suffered to blaze away
in the cool manner spoken of. Though of common origin, at least
on his mother's side, young Servius Tullius was supposed to have
been completely purified by the fire, which warmed the hearts of all
who came near him; and not only did the queen adopt him as her
own son, but the partial baking had produced such an effect upon his
very ordinary clay, that he was treated like a brick required for the
foundations of the royal house into which Tarquinius cemented him,
by giving him, as a wife, one of the daughters of the royal family.</p>

<p>Tanaquil having kept secret her husband's death, Servius Tullius
continued for some time to carry on the business of government, just as
if nothing had happened. When it was at length felt that the young
favourite of fortune had got the reins fairly in his hands, the murder
came out, and the barbarous assassination of Tarquinius was published
to the multitude. Servius was the first instance of a king who mounted
the throne without the aid of the customary pair of steps, consisting of
an election by the Senate, and a confirmation by the Curiæ.</p>

<p>It might have been expected that Servius, when elevated above his
own humble stock, might have held his head so high and become so
stiff-necked as to prevent him from noticing the rank from which he
had sprung; but, on the contrary, he exalted himself by endeavouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to raise others. His reign was not a continued round of fights, for
he preferred the trowel to the sword, and, instead of cutting his name
with the latter weapon, he wisely chose to build up his reputation
with the former instrument. His first care was to complete the city,
to which he added three hills, feeling, perhaps, that his fame would
become as ancient as the hills themselves; and with a happy perception
that if "walls have ears" they are just as likely to have tongues, he
surrounded Rome with a wall, which might speak to future ages of his
spirit and enterprise. He was a friend to insolvent debtors, to whom
he gave the benefit of an act of unexampled liberality. Desiring them
to make out schedules of their liabilities, he paid off the creditors in a
double sense, for they were extremely reluctant to receive the cash, the
payment of which cashiered their claim on the person and possessions
of their debtors. He abolished imprisonment for debt, giving power
to creditors over the goods and not the persons&mdash;or, as an ingenious
scholar has phrased it, the bona and not the bones&mdash;of their <a name="debtors" id="debtors"></a>debtors.</p>

<span class="caption">Debtor and Creditor.&mdash;Seizure of Goods for a Debt.</span><br />
</div>

<p><br />Servius found that while he was raising up buildings he was knocking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
down a great deal of money; but being nevertheless anxious to erect a
temple to Diana on the Aventine Hill he persuaded the Latins, who had
made the place a sort of <i>quartier Latin</i>, to subscribe to it. The Latins,
the Romans, and the Sabines, were every year to celebrate a sort of union
sacrifice on this spot, where the cutting up and cooking of oxen formed
what may be termed a joint festival. It happened that a Sabine
agriculturist had reared a prize heifer, which caused quite an effervescence
among his neighbours, and taking the bull quietly by the
horns, he asked the augur what it would be meet for him to do with it.
The soothsayer looked at the bull, who turned his brilliant bull's eye upon
the astonished sage, with a sort of supercilious stare that almost amounted
to a glaring oversight. The augur, not liking the look of the animal,
and anxious, no doubt, to put an end to the interview, declared that
whoever sacrificed the beast to Diana, off-hand, would benefit his race,
and cause his nation to rule over the other confederates. The animal
was led away with a shambling gait to the sacred shambles, where the
Roman priest was waiting to set his hand to any Bull that might be
presented to him. Seeing the Sabine preparing to act as slaughterman,
the pontiff became tiffy, and suggested, that if the other was going to do
the job, he might as well do it with clean hands, upon which the
Sabine rushed to the river to take a finger bath. While the owner was
occupied about his hands the Roman priest took advantage of the
pause to slaughter the animal, and, on his return, the Sabine found
that he had unintentionally washed his hands of the business altogether.
The oracle was thus fulfilled in favour of the Romans, who trumpeted
the fact through the bull's horns, which were hung up in front of the
temple in memory of this successful piece of priest-craft.</p>

<p>The growing popularity of Servius with the plebs made the patricians
anxious to get rid of him, for they had not the sense to feel that if they
aspired to be the pillars of the state, a close union with the class
beneath, or, as they would have contemptuously termed it, the base, was
indispensable. It happened that Servius, in the hope of propitiating the
two sons of Tarquinius, had given them his two daughters as their wives,
though it was a grievous mistake to suppose that family marriages are
usually productive of family union. Jealousy and quarrelling ensued,
which ended in the elder, Tullia, persuading her sister's husband Lucius
Tarquinius to murder his own brother and his own wife, in order that
he might make a match with the lump of female brimstone that had
inflamed his brutal passions. Not satisfied with the double murder,
which would have qualified her new husband to be struck in the hardest
wax and to occupy chambers among the worst of horrors, Tullia was
always whispering into his ear that she wished her father farther, and by
this demoniac spell she worked on the weak and wicked mind of Lucius
Tarquinius. It having been reported that Servius Tullus intended to
crown his own reign by uncrowning himself, and exchanging, as it were,
the royal stock for consuls, the patricians thought it would be a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
opportunity to speculate for a fall, by attempting the king's overthrow.
Tullia and her husband were asked to join in this conspiracy, when it
was found that the wretched and corrupt pair would be quite ripe for
any enormity. It was arranged, therefore, that Lucius Tarquinius, at
a meeting of the Senate, should go down to the House with all the
insignia of royalty, and, having seated himself upon the throne, the
trumpeters in attendance were, by one vigorous blow, to proclaim him
as the sovereign. When Servius heard the news he proceeded to the
Assembly, where all things&mdash;including the trumpets&mdash;seemed to be
flourishing in favour of the traitor. As the sound of the instruments
fell upon the old king's ears, he seemed to tremble for a moment before
the rude blast which threatened the blasting of all his benevolent views,
but calling out from the doorway in which he stood, he rebuked the
insolence and treachery of his son-in-law. A disgraceful scene ensued,
in which other blows than those of the trumpeters were exchanged, and
Servius, who had in vain desired the traitor to "come off the throne,"
was executing a threat to "pull him off" as well as the old man's
strength, or rather, his feebleness, would allow him. The senators
were watching the scene with the vulgar interest attaching to a prize
fight, and were no doubt backing up the combatants with the ordinary
expressions of encouragement, which we can only interpret by our own
familiar phrases of, "Go it," "Now then young 'un," "Bravo old 'un,"
and "Give it him." Getting rather too near the edge of the throne,
but holding each other firmly in their respective grasps, the two
combatants rolled together down the steps of the throne&mdash;an incident
not to be met with in the rolls of any other Parliament. Getting
immediately on to their legs they again resumed their hostile footing,
when Tarquinius being younger and fresher than his antagonist, seized
up the old man, now as feeble as an infant in arms, and carried his
brutality to such a pitch as to pitch him down the steps of the Senate
House. Servius tried in vain to pick up his courage, and being picked
up himself, he was on his road home when he was overtaken and
murdered in a street, which got the name of <i>Vicus Sceleratus</i>, or
Rascally Row, from the disgraceful row that occurred in it. Tullia was
driving down to the House to hear the news when her coachman pulled
up at the horrid sight of the king lying in the street, but the female
fury only ordered the man to "drive on," and it is said that she
enforced her directions by flinging a footstool at his head, though, on
subjecting the story to the usual tests, we find the footstool without a
leg to stand upon. Servius Tullus had reigned forty-four years, and
his memory was cherished for centuries after his death, his birthday
being celebrated on the Nones of every month, because he was known
to have been born on some nones, but which particular nones were
unknown to any one. We have already noticed the wall of Servius,
but we must not forget the Agger, or mound, connected with it, the
value of which was equal to that of the wall itself, and, indeed, those
who give the preference to the Agger over the wall do not much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
ex-aggerate. There remains to this day a great portion of the mound,
which was sixty feet high and fifty broad, skirted with flag stones
towards the outer side, and the Romans no doubt would derive more
security from laying down their flags on the outer wall than from
hanging out their banners.</p>

<p>The greatest work, however, of the reign of Servius was the reform
of the Constitution, which he constructed with a view to the reconciling
of the wide differences between the patricians and the plebeians, so as to
form one powerful body by making somebodies of those who had
hitherto been treated as nobodies. His first care was to divide the
plebeians into thirty tribes&mdash;a name derived from the word <i>tribus</i>, or
three, and applied to the three plebeian tribes&mdash;the derivation being
so simple that were we to ask any schoolboy if he understood it, his
answer would be, that "he might be whipped" and he would assuredly
deserve to be whipped "if he didn't." These thirty tribes were placed
under an officer called a <i>tribunus</i>, whose duty it was to keep a list of
the members and collect the <i>tributum</i>&mdash;a word, to which in the reader's
ready mind, the word tribute will at once be attributed. Besides the orders
of patricians and plebeians, whose position was determined by descent
alone, Servius thought there were many who might be connected together
by a tie proper to them all, namely, that of property. He accordingly
established a census to be held every five years, in which the name of
every one who had come to man's estate was put down, together with
the amount of his other estate, if he was lucky enough to have any. The
whole number was divided into two heads, one of which was foot, or
<i>pedites</i>, and the other horse, or <i>equites</i>, among whom an equitable
share of rights and duties had to be distributed. The <i>pedites</i>, or
infantry, were not all on the same footing, but were subdivided into six
classes, according to the amount of their possessions, which determined
their position in the army; but even the sixth class, or those who had no
other possession than their self-possession, were not excluded from the
service. Each class was divided into seniors and juniors, the former
being men between forty-five and sixty; the latter, including all below
forty-five and above seventeen, at which early age, though frequently
not bearded themselves, they were expected to go forth and beard the
enemy. In addition to the two assemblies of the curiæ (the <i>comitia
curiata</i>) and the tribes (the <i>comitia tributa</i>), there was instituted by
Servius a great national assembly called the <i>comitia centuriata</i>, and
consisting of the whole of the centuries. Of these centuries there were
altogether one hundred and ninety-three; but, instead of every
individual member being allowed a separate vote, the suffrage was
distributed amongst classes according to their wealth or the number of
asses they possessed, a principle which the opponent of a mere property
qualification will regard as somewhat asinine. By this arrangement
the poor were practically excluded from voting at all, unless the rich
were disagreed among themselves, when the merely industrious classes,
such as the <i>Fabri</i>&mdash;the very extensive family of the Smiths and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Carpenters&mdash;the <i>Cornicines</i>&mdash;the respectable race of Hornblowers&mdash;and
others of similar degree sometimes had sufficient weight to turn
the balance.</p>

<p>Though the equestrian centuries comprised the richest class, they
seem to have been in one respect little better than beggars on
horseback, for each eques received from the treasury a sum for the
purchase of his horse and an annual grant for its maintenance. The
amount was levied upon orphans and widows, who were, it is true,
exempt from other imposts, though their contributing from their slender
means to keep a horse on its legs caused many to complain that the law
rode rough-shod over them. The Assembly of the Centuries was a grand
step towards self-government, and, though many may think that wealth
had an actual preponderance, it was always possible for a member of a
lower class to get into a higher, and thus an inducement to self-advancement
was secured, which is, certainly, not one of the least useful ends of
government. There were numerous instances of energetic Romans rising
from century to century with a rapidity showing that they were greatly
in advance of the age, or, at all events, of the century in which they were
originally placed by their lot, or rather by their little.</p>

<p>Servius introduced into Rome the Etruscan As, of the value of which
we can give no nearer notion than by stating the fact that a Roman
sheep was worth about ten Etruscan asses. To the poorer classes these
coins could have been of little service, and by way of small change they
were permitted to use shells, from which we no doubt get the phrase of
"shelling out," a quaint expression sometimes used to describe the
process of paying. In some parts of the world shells are still current
as cash, and even among ourselves fish are employed at cards as the
representatives of money. Though in ordinary use for the smaller
purposes of commerce, shells were not receivable as taxes, for when the
Government required the sinews of war it would not have been satisfied
with mussels or any other similar substitute.</p>

<p>The Roman As was of bronze and stamped on one side with a
portrait of Janus, whose two heads we never thought much better than
one, though they appeared appropriately on a coin as a sign, perhaps,
that people are often made doublefaced by money. On the other side
was the prow of a ship, which might be emblematical of the fact that
money is necessary to keep one above water.</p>

<p>In the time of Servius all were expected to arm themselves according
to their means, and the richest were thoroughly clad in bronze for the
protection of their persons, while the poorer, who could not afford
anything of the kind, were obliged to trust for their self-defence to their
own natural metal. The patricians carried a clypeus, or shield, of
such dimensions as to cover frequently the whole body, and by hiding
himself behind it the wearer often escaped a hiding from the enemy.
The material of which the clypeus was composed was wood covered
with a bull's skin that had been so thoroughly tanned as to afford
safety against the severest <a name="leathering" id="leathering"></a>leathering.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br />CHAPTER THE FOURTH.</h2>

<h3>FROM THE ACCESSION OF TARQUINIUS SUPERBUS TO THE BANISHMENT<br />
OF THE ROYAL FAMILY, AND THE ABOLITION OF THE KINGLY DIGNITY.<br /><br /></h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 118px;">
<img src="images/i_p0033.png" width="118" height="150" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p><span style="margin-left:-1em;" class="smcap">arquinius</span> had ascended the
throne more by the
force of his fists, than
by the strength of his
arms; for he had aimed
a blow, not only at the
crown, but at the face of
the unhappy sovereign
who had preceded him.
Carrying his hostility
beyond the grave, Tarquinius
refused to bury
his animosity, or to
grant his victim a funeral.
The upstart nature
of the new king gained
for him the nickname of
Superbus, or the proud,
though he had as little
to be proud of as some of
the most contemptible
characters in history.
He, however, asserted
himself with so much
audacity, that the people were completely overawed by his pretensions,
and many made away with themselves, to insure their lives, by a sort
of Irish policy, against Tarquin's violence. He took away the privileges
of the plebeians, and sent many to the scaffold, by employing them as
common bricklayers; but there were several who preferred laying violent
hands on themselves, to laying a single brick of the magnificent
buildings which he planned, in the hope, perhaps, that the splendour of
the constructions of his reign would induce posterity to place the best
construction on his character.</p>

<p>He coolly assumed the whole administration of the law, and added
the office of executioner to that of judge, while he combined with both
the character of a criminal, by seizing the property of all those whom
he punished, and thus adding robbery to violence. To prevent the
possibility of a majority against him in the Senate, he cut off several
of the heads of that body; and though he never condescended to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
submit to the Assembly a single question, he treated the unhappy
members as if they had much to answer for.</p>

<p>Finding the continued ill-treatment of his own people getting rather
monotonous, he sought the pleasures of variety, by harassing the
Volscians, whom he robbed of a sufficient sum to enable him to commence
a temple to Jupiter. Bricks and mortar soon ran up above
the estimated cost; and Tarquin had scarcely built the lower floor,
when he came to the old story of shortness of funds, which he supplied
by making the people pay as well as work, and taxing at once their time
and their pockets. This temple was on the Capitoline Hill; and it is said
that in digging the foundations the workmen hit upon a freshly-bleeding
human head, which, of course, must be regarded as an idle tale; nor
would it be right for history to hold an elaborate inquest on this head,
since it would be impossible to find a verdict without having first found
the body. The augur, who, according to the legend, was present on
the occasion, is reported to have made a <i>post-mortem</i> examination of the
head, which he identified as that of one Tolus; but who Tolus was, or
whether he ever was at all, we are told nothing on any competent
authority. The augur, whose duty it was to be ready to interpret
anything that turned up, no sooner saw the head, than putting upon it
the best face he could, he declared it to be a sign that Rome was destined
to be the head of the world&mdash;an obvious piece of fulsome adulation,
worthy of being offered to the flattest of flats, by one disposed to
flatter. The temple itself was a great fact, notwithstanding the numerous
fictions that are told concerning it; and there is little doubt that
though, as some say, Tarquinius Priscus (the old one) may have begun
it, Tarquinius Superbus put to it the finishing touch, and surmounted it
with a chariot and four in baked clay, which, had it been preserved to
this day, would have been one of the most interesting of Potter's
<a name="Antiquities" id="Antiquities"></a>Antiquities.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Tarquinius Superbus has the Sibylline Books valued.</span><br /><br />
</div>

<p>A curious anecdote, connected with the bookselling business of the
period, has been handed down to us; and it is sufficiently interesting
to be handed on to the readers of this work, who are at liberty either to
take it up, or to set it down at its real value. It is said that Tarquin
was waited upon by a female, who brought with her nine books, and,
expressing herself willing to do business, asked three hundred pieces of
gold for the entire set of volumes. The King pooh-poohed the proposition,
on the ground of the exorbitant price, and desired her to be off with
the books, when she solemnly advised him not to off with the bargain.
Finding him obstinate, the woman, who was, it seems, a sibyl, and eked
out her bookseller's profits by the business of a prophetess, threw into
the flames three of the volumes, which, assuming, for a few minutes,
the aspect of illuminated copies, soon left no traces&mdash;not even a spark&mdash;of
any genius by which they might have been inspired. The sibyl,
soon after, paid a second visit to Tarquin, bringing with her the six
remaining volumes; and having asked in vain the same sum for the
imperfect copy as she had done for the whole work, she went through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
sort of second edition of Burns, by throwing three more of her books
into the fire. To the surprise of Tarquin, she appeared a third
time with her stock of books, now reduced to three; and upon the
King's observing to her "What do you want for these?" she replied
that three hundred pieces of gold was her price; that she made no
abatement; that if the books were not instantly bought, they would
speedily be converted into light literature, and being condensed
into one thick volume of smoke, would, of course, take their final
leaves of the royal residence. The King, astonished at the woman's
pertinacity, resolved at last to send for a valuer, to look at the books,
who declared them to be well worth the money. They contained a
variety of remedies for diseases, directions for preparing sacrifices, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
other interesting matter, with a collection of the oracles of Cumæ, by
way of appendix, so that the volumes formed a sort of encyclopædia,
embracing the advantages of a Cookery Book, a Buchan's Domestic
Medicine, and a Complete Fortune-teller. Tarquin<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> became the purchaser
of these three very odd volumes, which seem to have been
estimated less according to their intrinsic value, than the price they
had brought; and they were carefully put away in the Temple library.</p>

<p>It was the desire of the Government to prevent the people from
knowing what these books might contain, and the office of librarian was
entrusted to two individuals of illustrious birth, under the idea&mdash;not
very flattering to aristocracy&mdash;that patricians would be found the best
promoters of ignorance. One of these officers, having acted so inconsistently
with his rank, as to have imparted some information to a fellow-citizen,
was dismissed from his place and thrown into the sea in a bag;
so that he may be said, by the heartless punster, to have got the sack
in a double meaning.</p>

<p>While building operations were going on at home, destruction was
being dealt out abroad; and the Gabii being about twelve miles from
Rome, were the objects of the King's hostility. Having sent one of his
captains against them, who was repulsed by a major force, Tarquinius
resolved on trying treachery. He accordingly despatched his son, Sextus,
to complain of ill-treatment at his father's hands, and to implore the pity
of the Gabii, who were gabies enough not only to believe the story, but
even to appoint Sextus their general. He was ultimately chosen their
governor; and finding the Gabii completely in his hands, he sent to his
own governor&mdash;Tarquinius&mdash;to know what to do with them. The King
was in the garden when the messenger arrived; and whenever the
latter asked a question, the former made no reply, but kept knocking
off the heads of the tallest poppies with his walking-stick. The
messenger ventured to intimate, once or twice, that he was waiting for
an answer; but the heads of the poppies flying off in all directions, he
began to tremble for his own, and he flew off himself, to prevent accidents.
On his return, he mentioned the circumstances to Sextus, who
regarded the poppies as emblems of the Gabii; and, indeed, the latter
seemed so thoroughly asleep, that the comparison was no less just than
odious.</p>

<p>Sextus, taking the paternal hint, knocked off several of the heads of
the people; and keeping up the allegory to the fullest extent, cut off
the flower of the Gabii. Many of their fairest blossoms perished by a
too early blow; and being thus deprived of what might fairly be termed
its primest pick, the soil was soon planted with the victorious standards
of Tarquinius. He, however, instead of introducing any apple of discord,
judiciously grafted the Gabian on the Roman stock; and thus cultivated
the only really valuable fruits of victory.<br /><br /></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">The Evil Conscience of Tarquin.</span>
<br /><br /></div>

<p>Tarquin was a great deal troubled by the signs of the times; or,
rather, he was made so uncomfortable by an evil conscience, that if a
snake appeared in his path, it seemed to hang over him like a horrible
load; and if he went to sleep, there was a mare's-nest always at hand,
to trouble him with a night-mare. He dreamed that some eagles had
built in his gardens, and that in their temporary absence from the nest,
some vultures had breakfasted on the new-laid eggs, and, armed with
their beaks, taken possession of the deserted small tenement. Unable
to drive the vultures out of his head, he was anxious to ascertain the
meaning of the omen, for he had become so superstitious, that if he saw
a sparrow dart from a branch, he regarded it as an emblem that he was
himself about to hop the twig in some unexpected manner. Doubting
the efficiency of his own augurs, on whom he was beginning to throw
some of the discredit to which prophets in their own country are liable,
Tarquin resolved on seeking the aid of foreign talent; and as the
omens were worse than Greek to him, he sent to the oracles at Delphi,
thinking if the matter was Greek to them they would be able to interpret
it. His messengers to the fortune-tellers were his two sons, Aruns
and Titus, together with his nephew, one Lucius Junius Brutus, who,
though an extremely sensible young man, was in the habit of playing
the fool, in order to avert the suspicions of his uncle. Though Brutus
assumed the look of an idiot, and generally had his eye on vacancy, it
was only to conceal the fact that a vacancy on the throne was
what he really had his eye upon. Valuable gifts were taken to the
oracle, which was slow to speak in the absence of presents. When
Brutus put a <i>báton</i> into the hand of the Priestess, she knew, by the
weight, that the <i>báton</i> was a hollow pretext for the conveyance of a
bribe, which she looked for, found, and pocketed. On the strength of
a large lump of gold, thus cunningly conveyed to the Priestess, Brutus
ventured to ask who would be the next King of Rome, to which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
replied by a recommendation that all the applicants should go home to
their mothers, for that "he who kissed his mother first should be the
one to govern." Titus and Aruns made at once for their mamma, and
eager to kiss her, ran as fast as they could to catch the first bus, but
Brutus, whom they had perhaps tripped up, to prevent his getting a
fair start, saluted his mother earth with a smack of the lip in return for
the blow on the face that his fall had occasioned him.</p>

<p>When the ambassadors returned to Rome they found Tarquin as
nervous as ever; and there is little doubt, that if tea had been known
in those days, the King would have sat for ever over his cups, endeavouring
to read the grounds for his fears in the grounds of the beverage.
The treasury having been exhausted by his building speculations, the
people were growing more dissatisfied every day; and, in order to turn
their discontent away from home, he engaged them in a quarrel with
Ardea, a city situated on a lofty rock, against which the Romans threw
themselves with a sort of dashing energy. The attempt to take the
place by a common assault and battery was vain, for the rock stood firm;
and it was probable, that if the Romans remained at the gates, and
continued knocking over and over again, they would ultimately be compelled
to knock under. They therefore resolved on hemming the Ardeans
in, as there was no chance of whipping them out, and military works
were run in a continuous thread round the borders of the city.</p>

<p>The Romans, acting as a sort of army of occupation, had, of course,
scarcely any occupation at all; and there being nothing that soldiers
find it so difficult to kill as their time, the officers were in the habit
of going halves in suppers at each other's quarters. At one of these
entertainments the King's sons, and their cousin, one Tarquinius, surnamed
Collatinus, from the town of Collatia, were discussing the merits
of their respective wives, and each of the officers, with an uxuriousness
among the military that the commonest civility would have restrained,
was praising his own wife at the expense of all others.</p>

<p>It was at length agreed that the husbands should proceed forthwith to
Rome, and that having paid an unexpected visit to all the ladies, the palm
should be awarded to her who should be employed in the most praiseworthy
way, when thus unceremoniously popped in upon. They first
visited the wife of Sextus, who had got a large evening party and ball
at home, and who was much confused by this unexpected revelation of
her midnight revels. Dancing was at its height; and as a great writer
has said of dancing among the Romans, "<i>Nemo fere saltat sobrius,
nisi forte insaniat</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>&mdash;any one who dances must be either very drunk,
or stark mad,&mdash;we may guess the state of the company that Sextus
found at his residence. In one corner the game of <i>Par et Impar</i>&mdash;"odd
or even"&mdash;might perhaps have been played; for nothing can be more
purely classical than the origin of some of those sports which form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
almost the only pretexts for the employment of our modern street-keepers.
A portion of the guests might have been amusing themselves
with the <i>Tali</i>, or "knuckle-bones," others might have been employed
at <i>Jactus bolus</i>&mdash;"pitch and toss;" while here and there among the
revellers might have been heard the familiar cry of <i>Aut caput aut navem</i>&mdash;the
"heads or tails" <a name="of_antiquity" id="of_antiquity"></a>of antiquity.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Mrs. Sextus consoles herself with a Little Party.</span><br /><br />
</div>

<p>Their next call was at the house of Collatinus, whose wife, Lucretia,
was also engaged with a ball, but it was of cotton, and instead of
devoting herself to the whirl of the dance, she was spinning with
her maids, by way of spinning out the long, dreary hours of her
husband's absence. Sextus at once admitted that Collatinus had
indeed got a treasure of a wife, and the officers returned to the camp;
but a few evenings afterwards, availing himself of the introduction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
her husband, Sextus paid the lady a second visit. Being a kinsman,
he was asked to make himself at home, but his manner became so
strange, that Lucretia could not make him out; and as he did not seem
disposed to go home till morning, she retired to her chamber, with the
impression, no doubt, that being left alone in the sitting-room he would
take the hint, order his horse, and proceed to his lodgings. Lucretia
was, however, disturbed in the middle of the night by Sextus, who was
standing over her with a drawn sword, and who was guilty of such
brutal insolence, that she sent a messenger, the first thing in the
morning, to fetch her husband from Ardea, and her father from Rome,
who speedily arrived with his friend, P. Valerius, a highly respectable
man, who afterwards got the name of Publicola. Collatinus brought with
him L. J. Brutus, and Lucretia having rapidly run through the story
of her wrongs, she still more rapidly run through herself before any one
had time to arrest the deadly weapon. Revenge against Tarquin and
his whole race was instantly sworn, in a sort of quartette, by the four
friends, and L. J. Brutus, snatching up the dagger, made a great
point of it in a speech he addressed to the people in the market place.
Indignation was now thoroughly roused against the Tarquin family, and
Brutus, proceeding to Rome, called a public meeting in the Forum. He
opened the business of the day by stating what had been done, and
having made his deposition he proposed the deposition of the king;
when it was moved, by way of amendment, and carried unanimously,
that the resolution should be extended by the addition of the words,
"and the banishment of his wife and family." A volunteer corps was at
once formed to set out for Ardea, where the king was supposed to
be; but on hearing of the insurrection, he had at once decamped from
the camp, and proceeded to Rome, where he found the gates closed, and
feeling himself shut out from the throne, he took refuge with his two
sons, Titus and Aruns, at Caere, in Etruria. There history loses sight
of the old king, but Sextus has been traced to Gabii, a principality
of which he thought he was the head; but the people soon undeceived
him, by showing him they would have no head at all, for they cut him
off one day in a tumult.</p>

<p>Tullia had fled, and it is not known whither; but mercy to the
fallen king would lead us to hope that the queen had gone in a
different direction from that which he had taken. The Ardeans
agreed to a truce for fifteen years&mdash;a somewhat lengthy letter of
license&mdash;during which all hostile proceedings were to be stayed, and
the people decreed the total abolition of the kingly dignity. The royal
stock was converted, as it were, into consuls, and L. Junius Brutus,
with L. Tarquinius Collatinus, were elected for one year, to fill the
latter character.</p>

<p>Before closing an account of what is usually termed the kingly period
of the history of Rome, it is due to truth to state, that though some of
the alleged kings were good and others were bad, they must all be
considered as very doubtful characters. The fact of their existence
depends on no better authority than certain annals, compiled more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
a century and a half after the materials for compiling them had been
destroyed; and we are thus driven to rely upon the statements of certain
story-tellers, belonging, we fear, to a class, whose memories, according
to the proverb, ought to be excellent. In pretending to recollect what
they never knew, they have sometimes forgotten themselves, and in
building up their stories, they have shown how mere fabrication may
raise an ostensibly solid fabric.</p>

<p>Of the seven kings, who are said to have ruled in Rome during a
period of nearly two hundred and fifty years, three or four were
murdered; another subsided in a bog, and another ran for his life,
which he saved by his speed, though he was the last of the race of royalty.
It is difficult to spread these seven sovereigns over a space of two
centuries and a half, and we feel that we might as well attempt to cover
an acre of bread with a thin slice of ham, or turn the river Thames into
negus by throwing a few glasses of sherry into it. Of the earliest
Roman annals, some were burnt, leaving nothing to the student but the
tinder, from which it is, in these days, hardly possible to obtain much
light, but the greater portion of the early history of Rome has come
down to us by tradition, that extraordinary carrier, who is continually
adding to the bulk, but diminishing the weight of the matters consigned
to it for delivery.</p>

<p>Of the condition of the people at this early period little or nothing
can be known, and to amuse ourselves with idle guesses, would be scarcely
better than to turn into a game of blindman's buff the important
business of history. We can however state, with confidence, that the
earliest Romans had no regular coinage, but were in the habit of
answering with brass, in the rudest shape, the demands of their
creditors. Servius Tullius is reputed to have been the first who converted
the brass into coin, and marked it with the figure of a horse or
some other animal,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> as an emblem, perhaps, of the fact, that money
runs away very rapidly.</p>

<p>Among the early Romans, the most honourable occupations were
agriculture and war; the latter enabling the citizens to make a conquest
of the soil with the sword, and the former teaching them to subdue it to
their purposes by the implements of husbandry. Trade and commerce
were held in contempt, and left to the plebeians; the patrician considering
himself suitably employed only when he was thrashing his corn, or
performing the same operation on his enemies.</p>

<p>During the early existence of the city the native artists were few, and
the great works of architecture undertaken by the later kings were
embellished by foreign talent from Etruria. The writing-master had
made so little progress in ancient Rome, that it is doubtful whether
many of the patricians could write their own names; and even some of
the most distinguished characters of the day were men of mark, not only
by their position, but by their signatures.
</p>

<p>It is not very gratifying to the friends of education to find that though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
ignorance was almost universal among the early Romans, there was a
wholesome tone of morality among the people, which led them, not only
to condemn in their traditions the cruelty and laxity of principle prevailing
in the family of their last king, but to pay due reverence to the
domestic virtues of Lucretia. The legend of the latter being found
spinning with her maids, while the princesses of the house of Tarquin
were reeling in the dance, during the absence of their respective husbands,
is sufficient to show the estimation in which decency and
sobriety were held, as well as the odium that attached to riotous revelry.
The patrician youth of infant and unlettered Rome would have been
ashamed of those nocturnal gambols which have prevailed among portions
of the juvenile aristocracy and gentry in more civilised countries,
and in a more enlightened age, when door-knockers, and bell-handles,
have been carried off as the <i>spolia opima</i> of some disorderly triumph.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>FROM THE BANISHMENT OF TARQUINIUS SUPERBUS TO THE BATTLE OF<br />
LAKE REGILLUS.<br /><br /></h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 113px;">
<img src="images/i_p0043.png" width="113" height="200" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p><span style="margin-left:-1em" class="smcap">rutus</span>, who had gained his eminence by
swearing that there should be no monarch
or single ruler in Rome, found himself in
sole possession of the supreme authority.
His position presents nothing very remarkable
to the modern observer, who is accustomed
to see those who have denounced a
system yesterday participating in the profits
of the same system to-day, and declaring
their own arguments to be thoroughly out
of place, as applied to themselves when in
office. Brutus, however, could not consistently
exercise a power he had sworn
to overthrow; and to carry out his anti-monarchical
principles, he had either to
go out himself, or to ask for a colleague.
On the same principle that prefers the half
quartern to utter loaflessness, Brutus proposed
a partnership in the government;
and Collatinus was taken into the firm, which proved to have no
firmness at all, for it was dissolved very speedily. The difficulty of
agreement between two of the same trade was severely felt by the
two popular reformers, who were dividing the substance without the
name of that power they had vowed to destroy; it was soon evident
that if they had thought it too much for one, they considered it not
enough for two; and they were accordingly always quarrelling. To
prevent collision, they tried the experiment of taking the supreme
authority by turns, each assuming the fasces for a month at a time; but
this alternate chopping of the regal sticks, or fasces, which were the
emblems of power, led to nothing satisfactory.</p>

<p>A question at length arose, upon which the duality of the ruling
mind was so distinctly marked, that the two consuls, whose very name
is derived from <i>con</i>, with, and <i>salio</i>, to leap, were trying to leap in two
opposite ways; and an end of their own power was the only conclusion
to which they were likely to jump together. Tarquin had retired to
Caere, waiting the chances of a restoration of his line; but his line had
fallen into such contempt, that he was fishing in vain for his recall,
though he nevertheless sent ambassadors to demand the restoration of
himself, or at all events of his private property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
The senate decreed that though Tarquin could not have the fasces,
he was at liberty to make a bundle of all the other sticks that might
belong to him. On this question Brutus and Collatinus were violently
opposed, and both becoming hot, their excessive warmth led to a mutual
coolness that ended in an open hostility, which shut out every hope of
compromise. Collatinus gave in by going out, and was succeeded by
P. Valerius, one of the party of four who had roused the popular spirit
over the bier of Lucretia.</p>

<p>Tarquin's ambassadors, instead of being satisfied with the permission
to remove his goods, had other objects in the back-ground; for they
had a plan for his restoration in the rear, while they let nothing appear
in the van, but the late king's furniture. The plot was being discussed
after dinner, by a party of the conspirators, when one of the waiters,
who had concealed himself behind the door, overheard the scheme, and
ran to Valerius with the exclusive intelligence. The traitors were
secured, and when they were brought up before the consuls, Brutus
recognising among the offenders his two sons, subjected both them and
himself to a very severe trial. Asking them what they had to say to
the charge, and getting "nothing" in reply, he looked in the faces of
his sons, and declaring that he must class all malefactors under one
general head, which must be cut off, he called upon the lictors to do
their duty. In leaving the other prisoners to be tried by Valerius,
Brutus whispered to his colleague, "Now try them, and acquit them, if
you can;" but he could only execute the law, and the law could only
execute the criminals. The ambassadors were allowed to remain at
large, though their plotting proved that they had been at something
very little; and the government withdrew the permission that had
been granted for the removal of Tarquin's goods, which were divided by
means of a scramble among the populace.</p>

<p>Thus Tarquin, who had broken the twenty valuable tables of Servius,
was doomed to have the tables turned upon him by the destruction of
his own, while every leaf of the former was restored under the Consular
government. The landed estates of the Tarquins were distributed
among the plebeians, so that the banished family had no chance of
recovering their lost ground, which was afterwards known as the Field
of Mars, or Campus Martius. The corn on the confiscated property
was ripe; but the people felt a conscientious objection to consuming
the produce which no labour of their own had reared; and they did not
allow the tyrant's grain to outweigh their honest scruple. Throwing
all idea of profit overboard, they cast the corn into the Tiber, which, it
is said, was so shallow, that the sheaves stuck in the mud, and
formed the small island known as the Insula Tiberina. That a piece
of land, however small, should be formed by a crop of corn, however
plentiful, is difficult to believe: but the story of the wheat can only
find reception from the very longest ears; for common sense will admit
that in the effort to give credit to the tale, it must go thoroughly
against the grain on a proper sifting of all the evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Tarquin relinquishing his hopes of a restoration by stratagem,
resolved on resorting to strategy, and brought into the field a large
army, of which the Veii formed a considerable part, and his son Aruns
headed the Etruscan cavalry. The Roman consuls commanded their
own forces; Valerius being at the head of the foot, and Brutus
mounted on a clever cob, with a strong sword, that might be called a
useful hack, taking the lead of the equestrians. When Aruns entered
the field, he recognised Brutus in Tarquin's cloak, and the young man
felt the blood mantling with indignation into his cheek at the first
sight of the mantle. He instantly made for Brutus, who with equal
eagerness made for Aruns, and so violent was the collision, that the
breath was knocked at one blow out of both their bodies.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Aruns and Brutus.</span><br /><br />
</div>

<p>The hostile leaders having fallen to the ground, the battle shared
their fate, and both armies withdrew to their camps; but neither would
allow the other the credit of a victory. The legend goes on to state
that the god Silvanus&mdash;an alarmist among the classical deities, and
synonymous with Pan&mdash;was heard shouting in the night that the
Etruscans having lost one man more than the Romans, the latter had
gained the battle. This announcement of the result of the contest,
though only by a majority of one, so alarmed the Etruscans, who were
always panic struck at the voice of Pan, that they took to flight, leaving
the enemy to carry everything before them, including all the property
that the fugitives had left behind them. The remains of Brutus were
brought to the Forum, where they lay in state; but the state in which
they lay was truly deplorable; for the deceased consul had been so
knocked about, that had he been alive, he would scarcely have
known himself, even by the aid of reflection. His colleague, Valerius,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
delivered an oration over his departed virtues, making a catalogue of
the whole, and fixing the highest price to every one of them.</p>

<p>The question of "Shall Brutus have a statue?" was soon answered
in the affirmative, and he was placed among the kings, though he had
destroyed the monarchy. Where failure constitutes the traitor, success
makes the patriot: and upon the merest accident may depend the question
whether the originator of a design against a bad government shall go to
the block of the sculptor, or to that of the executioner.</p>

<p>P. Valerius was in no hurry to ask the people for a colleague, and
he for some time did the whole of the business of the chief magistracy
himself; so that had it not been for the mere name of the office,
Rome might just as well have remained a monarchy. This fact seems
to have flashed at last on the public mind; and when it was found that
P. Valerius was building himself a stone residence, in a strong position, a
rumour was spread abroad that he was aiming at the foundation of his
own house, or family, in the kingly power. On hearing the report he
immediately stopped the works of his intended residence, and having
called a meeting of the curiæ, he appeared before them with his fasces
reversed; a sign that the bundles of rods were not intended to be used on
the backs of the people alone, but that they were held, as it were, in
trust, and in pickle for the punishment of delinquency in general. This
treatment of the fasces so fascinated the people, that they acquitted
P. Valerius of every charge, and acknowledging their suspicions of a
plot to be groundless, they gave him a plot of ground to build his house
upon. Pleased with the taste of popularity, he continued to court it
with so much success, that he gained the name of Publicola, or one
who honours the public; and he certainly introduced many very wholesome
legal reforms, by dabbling in law, in a spirit truly lau-dable. He
gave an appeal from the magistrate to the people, in cases where the
punishment awarded had been a fine, a whipping, or a hanging; and
in the last instance the provision was extremely salutary, for the suspending
of a sentence might often avoid the necessity for suspending
an alleged criminal. This right of appeal was, however, limited to
within a mile from the city; an arrangement that would have justified
the formation of a league to abolish the mile, as an unnecessary distinction,
of which we can only expose the absurdity, by suggesting the
possibility of an offence committed at Knightsbridge being punishable
at Newgate with immediate death; while the culprit of Holborn Hill,
though nearer the place of execution, would be further from the scaffold.</p>

<p>Having passed several salutary acts, and secured, as it were, the cream
of popularity to himself, he proposed the election of a colleague who might
share the skim with him. The new consul was Spurius Lucretius; but
poor Spurius enjoyed none of the genuine sweets of power. He was so
far advanced in years, at the period of his advancement to office, that he
had already one foot in the grave, and the other foot went in after it
immediately on his taking his new position. M. Horatius Pulvillius was
chosen in the poor old man's stead, and an incident speedily happened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
which caused a difference, leading to something more than personal
indifference between the two consuls. The temple of Jupiter, on the
Capitoline, so called from the incident already related, of the Caput
Toli, or head of Tolus, had not yet been dedicated; and it having been
arranged that the thing was to be done, the next question that arose
was, "Who is to do it?" Both consuls were anxious for the job; and
it was at length arranged that lots should be drawn, in order to settle
the undecided point, which had led to such a decided coolness between
P. Valerius and his colleague. Horatius was the happy man whom
fortune favoured by her choice; and he was in the act of performing
the ceremony, when, without any ceremony at all, a messenger rushed
in, exclaiming that the son of the consul had suddenly expired. Believing
the alarm to be false, Horatius hinted at his suspicion of its being
one of the blackest of jobs, by suggesting that those who brought the
news should go and attend the funeral. "As for me," he exclaimed,
"I have other engagements just now;" and, continuing the work of
dedication, he proceeded to mark the commencement of a new era, by
driving a huge nail into the wall of the temple. Such was the mode
by which chronology was taught to the early Romans, who had their
dates literally hammered into them; and, as long as the consul hit the
right nail upon the head, or went upon the proper tack, mistake was
almost impossible.</p>

<p>The first specimen of diplomacy to be met with in the records of
Rome must be referred to the first year of the Republic, when a treaty
was concluded with Carthage, and engraved on brazen tables. The
material was appropriate to the purpose it served; and the language
was so obscure, that a modern treaty could scarcely have surpassed it
in ambiguity. Some parts of it were unintelligible to the most learned
of the Romans themselves; and, had any difference arisen as to the
interpretation of the treaty, the tables must have been left to brazen it
out; for no one could have explained their meaning. Though the document
may have mystified many things, it made one thing clear, for it proved
history to have been wrong in stating that Horatius succeeded Brutus,
for they are described as both being consuls together at the date of the
treaty. In following the ordinary version or perversion of the facts or
fictions connected with the rise of Rome, we take history as we find it;
and though much of it is known to be false, we, by continually making
the admission, prevent the bane from remaining very long without the
antidote.</p>

<p>P. Valerius was still consul, with P. Lucretius for a colleague, when
the old King Tarquin happened to be on a visit, at Clusium, in Etruria,
with the local Lar, Porsenna.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> After supper, Tarquin often grew
garrulous about his alleged wrongs, and worked on the sympathies of
his host, who declared the Romans should receive, through the medium
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of Porsenna, a tremendous physicking. The Lar accordingly set forth
at the head of his army, and its approach being announced, the people
in the suburbs of Rome were frightened out of their wits, and into the
city. Throughout the whole of his journey, Porsenna administered a
strong dose to all that opposed his way; and he scoured the country by
the most drastic system of pillage. On arriving at Rome, he at once
forced the Janiculum, the garrison rushing with their leader at their
head, and the foe almost at their heels, into the city. Nothing was now
between the Romans and their assailants but the wooden bridge, or
<i>Pons Sublicius</i>; and when the people asked for consolation from their
consul, he had none to offer them. Looking at the water, he saw there
was no time for reflection; and he ordered the bridge to be cut down,
when Horatius Cocles, the gatekeeper, volunteered to offer a check to
the enemy. "I want but two," cried Horatius, "two only are wanted,
to join with me in throwing for that great stake, the safety of Rome;"
and there immediately presented themselves, as ready to "stand the
hazard of the die," if die they must, the youthful Spurius Lartius of the
Neminian race, and Herminius, belonging to the Tities. The three
heroes took their station at the foot of the bridge, resolved that no one
should pass without paying a poll-tax, in the shape of a blow on the
head, which the valiant trio stood prepared to administer. A shout of
derisive laughter was the only salute they received from the Etruscan
army; but the laughter was soon transferred to the other side of the
Etruscan mouth, and subsided altogether when no less than half-a-dozen
tongues were found to have licked the dust, instead of the enemy.
Porsenna's army had advanced to the sound of trumpets, which seemed
no longer in a flourishing condition, but were as incapable of dealing
out a blow as the soldiers themselves. A few of the troops in the rear
shouted "Forward!" to those in the van; but there was such a determined
cry of "Keep back!" among the foremost men, that all were
under the influence of a general gib, and every rank gave evidence of
rank cowardice.</p>

<p>While the Etruscans were shaking in their shoes on one side of the
river, the Romans were shivering their own timbers, and knocking
down beams and rafters on the other. They had razed the bridge to
the ground, or rather lowered it to the water, when they called to their
gallant defenders to come back, while there was still a plank left&mdash;a
single deal to enable them to cut over to their partners.</p>

<p>Lartius and Herminius, seeing the game was nearly over, thought the
only card they had to play was to discard their companion, and save
themselves by a trick, which, however, would leave all the honours to
Horatius. The two former darted across just before the remainder of
the bridge fell, splashing into the water below, and rendering the tide
untidy with the broken fragments.</p>

<p>Horatius was now alone in his glory, with the foe before him, and
the flood behind; his only alternative being between a fatally hot reception
by the one, and an uncomfortably cold reception by the other.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Disdaining to beg for mercy from Porsenna, he prayed for pity from the
Tiber, and making a bold plunge, he threw himself on the kind indulgence
of the river. Being fastened up in armour, his case was a particularly
hard one, and being encumbered as he was with his arms, to
use his legs was scarcely possible. He nevertheless got on swimmingly,
for his heart never sank, and at length, feeling his foot touch the
bottom, he knew that his hopes were not groundless.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_p0049.png" width="400" height="330" alt="Horatius Cocles Defending the Bridge." title="" />
<span class="caption">Horatius Cocles Defending the Bridge.</span><br /><br />
</div>

<p>By courage and strength Horatius prevailed over every obstacle, and
Cocles owed to the cockles of his heart, as well as to the muscles of his
body, the happy results of his hazardous experiment. To recompense
him for his risk by water, the grateful nation gave him a large portion
of land, and erected his statue in the Comitium, a portion of the Forum
from which orators were in the habit of holding forth, and where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
figure of Horatius was placed to speak for itself to the populace.
Though the enemy was kept out of the city, the Romans were kept
in, while provisions were growing shorter and shorter every day&mdash;a sort
of growth that led of course to a constant diminution. Such was the
gratitude of the citizens to Horatius, that they subscribed to give him
always as much as he could eat; and although the fact involves a pun
we abominate, we are obliged to state the truth, that, in order to give
him his desert, many went without their dinners.</p>

<p>The Romans had declared they would hold out to the last, and
though they were left with scarcely any food, though they might
have at once procured it, had they consented to eat their own
words, they declined to satisfy their hunger by such a humiliating
process. All hope of saving the city being apparently lost, the senate
entered into an agreement with one Caius Mucius, who could talk a
little Tuscan, and who undertook to go across the water for the purpose
of killing Porsenna. Mucius disguised himself in an Etrurian helmet&mdash;a
sort of Tuscan bonnet&mdash;and with a sword concealed under the
folds of his ample Roman wrap-rascal, he arrived at Porsenna's
camp, just as the salaries were being paid to the soldiers. While
the troops were intent on drawing their pay, Mucius slily drew
his sword, and seeing an individual rather handsomely dressed, rushed
upon him to administer to him, with the weapon, a most unhandsome
dressing.</p>

<p>The individual thus assailed was rapidly despatched, but it turned out
that the victim, instead of being the king, was an unfortunate scribe, or
writer, who could have been by no means prepared for this unusual fate
of genius. Had the critics unmercifully cut him up, the scribe would
have felt that his death was, to a certain extent, in the way of business;
but to be murdered by mistake for a king, was a result that any member
of the republic of letters might fairly have objected to. It may appear
at first sight startling that a literary man should have been well-dressed,
and in the company of a king, but it must be remembered
that the scribe was not necessarily a man of remarkable ability. His
art was that of a mere copyist, which, even in these days, frequently
gains a reputation for the imitator, who is often confounded with,
instead of being confounded by the man of original genius. The
scribes of antiquity, like many modern writers, did no more than set
down the thoughts of others, and, as their style was extremely hard,
consisting of a piece of iron, with which they wrote upon wax, their
works were not likely to make a very deep or lasting impression.</p>

<p>Our pity for the unfortunate literary character is considerably
lessened by the fact, that being in the camp he had no doubt been dining
with the guards; and we know he was wearing a showy dress&mdash;two
circumstances indicating an affectation of the manners of the fast man,
which are always unbecoming to the man of letters.</p>

<p>Mucius was about to retire after the execution of the deed, but he was
seized by the attendants, and then seized by remorse when he was informed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
that he had despatched a harmless literary man instead of Porsenna.
Being taken to the king, Mucius found him sitting before the fire of a
large altar. The Etruscan chief, on hearing the charge, pointed out the
penalty that had been incurred, when the prisoner, thrusting his right
hand into the fire, allowed it to remain, with extraordinary coolness, or,
rather, with most intense heat, until it was consumed as far as the wrist;
and he concluded the act of self incendiarism, by declaring there were
three hundred others who were just as ready as himself to take up arms
and burn off a hand, in defiance of their oppressor. Porsenna, who had
watched the painful process with extreme interest, was so delighted at the
fortitude displayed, that he jumped from his seat, and mentally remarking
that "the fellow was a wonderfully cool hand at an operation of the
kind," ordered some guards to conduct him in safety to Rome; at the
same time advising Mucius to conduct himself more wisely for the
future.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Mucius Scævola before Porsenna.</span><br /><br />
</div>

<p>Mucius returned to Rome, where he obtained the name of Scævola
(from <i>Scærus</i>) in consequence of his being left-handed, or it might have
been because of his having evinced such an utter want of dexterity in
the business he had undertaken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Porsenna, having heard that there were three hundred Romans
ready to take his life, felt uneasy at such fearful odds as three
hundred to one against him; nor could he enjoy a moment's peace with
himself until a peace with Rome was concluded. He sent ambassadors
to negotiate a treaty, which was soon arranged; the only difficulty
arising on the subject of the proposed restoration of Tarquin, which his
subjects would not listen to; and, though he and Porsenna had hitherto
rowed in the same boat, the latter found it absolutely necessary to
throw the former overboard. Rome was compelled to return the territory
taken from the Veii, and Porsenna claimed several hostages, among
whom were sundry young ladies of the principal Roman families. One
of these was named Clælia, who, with other maidens, having resolved on
a bold plunge for their liberty, jumped into the Tiber's bed, and swam like
a party of ducks to the other side of the river. Clælia ran home in her
dripping clothes, but, instead of a warm reception, she was met with a
wet blanket, for her father fearing that her having absconded would be
visited upon Rome, sent her back like a runaway school-girl to the
camp of Porsenna. That individual behaved with his usual magnanimity,
for he not only pardoned Clælia and her companions, but sent
them home to their parents, who, perhaps, knew better than Porsenna
how to manage them.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Clælia and her Companions escaping from the Etruscan Camp.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />The Etruscan monarch seems to have been one of those who could
do nothing by halves, but having once granted quarter to the foe, he
was not satisfied until he had surrendered the whole of what he had
taken from the vanquished. He gave them unprovisionally all the
provisions remaining in his camp, and, in fact, he left behind him so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
many goods and chattels, that at public auctions it was customary for
many years afterwards to advertise the effects as "the property of
King Porsenna." Returning to Clusium, he is believed to have shut
himself up at home, and never stirred out again, for we meet with him
no more in any of the highways or byways of history.</p>

<p>The Romans having recovered from the blow, or series of blows, they
had received from Porsenna, were prepared to turn their anger on the
subject nearest at hand, and the Sabines were conveniently situated to
receive a great deal of it. Irritated by the enemy, the Sabines lost
their temper towards each other, and several of them, among whom
were Atta Clausus, or Appius Claudius and family, went over to Rome.
The renegades were received by their new allies with honour; for
apostacy, which should carry with it disgrace, was even in those days
treated too often as a virtue. The Claudii were made patricians of
Rome, which seems to have always courted converts by offering the highest
price to those who were ready to part with their old opinions and principles.
Valerius Publicola&mdash;or as some call him, Popli-cola, one who
honoured the people&mdash;died soon after the last-mentioned event, and
received the compliment of a magnificent funeral. The procession
commenced with a band of pipers, every one of whom the public
paid, and the crown was carried in state; but on such an occasion
as this, the empty crown could be suggestive of nothing but its own
hollowness.</p>

<p>The armour belonging to the deceased was buried with him, as if in
mockery of its uselessness against the attacks of the grim enemy; and
the face was painted, as is still the custom in Italy, where the attempt
to disguise the complexion to which we must come at last, only gives to
the reality a hideousness neither necessary nor natural. After the
funeral of a great or a much lamented man, it was usual to hang branches
of cypress on his house, and his gates were decorated with pine by those
who were left pining after him.</p>

<p>It was about this period that the great battle of Lake Regillus is
supposed to have been fought, when the Latins, who had been trying to
translate into Latin everything belonging to Rome, were at length
taught that the Roman character was strong enough to maintain its own
individuality.</p>

<p>In times of extreme peril, it has always been found that two heads,
instead of being better than one, are likely to neutralise each other, and
to reduce the supreme power under one head is the best mode of making
it effectual. The Romans, when seriously threatened by the Latins,
proceeded at once to the appointment of a dictator, from whose decrees
there should be no appeal; so that whatever he said should be no
sooner said than done&mdash;a principle of action which contributes materially
to the success of every great enterprise. P. Lartius was the first
dictator; but we can find no traces of his dictation, and he seems to
have been speedily superseded by Aulus Postumius, whose sword is said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to have been known "to bite,"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>&mdash;a propensity which must have
rendered his blade rather liable to snap, unless its temper was excellent.
The appointment of dictator was only for six months; so that the people
were soon absolved from the absolute power under which they placed
themselves. The best piece of patronage at the disposal of the dictator,
was the place of Master of the Horse, which Aulus conferred on
Æbutius; the latter acting completely under the guidance of the
former, who never parted with the reins while deputing the mastership
of the horse to another. Aulus and Æbutius set forward towards the
Lake Regillus, on the margin of which they waited till it was pitch dark
before they pitched their tent, with the intention of preparing for a
pitched battle.</p>

<p>The Latins were led by Mamilius, and the foe being face to face,
engaged themselves hand to hand with the most desperate energy.
According to the legend, Æbutius and Mamilius, meeting in the thick
of the fight, came individually to blows, which resulted in the unhorsing
of the Master of the Horse, who was almost bored to death with the
points of the swords of the enemy. At one time the battle seemed so
much in favour of the Latins, that Aulus entreated the Romans not to
resign themselves to the ravens, to be crowed over in a double sense, by
the birds of prey and the enemy. So mutual was the slaughter, and so
equal the bravery on both sides, that it would have been difficult to
decide the battle; and the legend, in its equal apportionment of valour
to each party, would have come to no practical result, had not supernatural
agency stepped in opportunely to give to one side the victory.
Two gigantic youths were seen fighting on the Roman side, and though
nobody knew their names, their address was the admiration of every
one. Their valour was shown at the expense of the unfortunate Latins,
who, unable to sustain the heavy charge that was now made upon them,
made no further attempt to meet any engagement, but resorted to
flight, as the only act that seemed to offer benefit.</p>

<p>The warriors wore nothing on their heads, and many surmises arose
as to who they could be; but nobody suspected the truth,&mdash;that the
heroes, without helmets or hats, were Castor, who never was unaccompanied
by his friend Pollux, and Pollux, who never went anywhere
without his Castor. The same noble youths were the first to announce
in Rome the news of the victory, acting as "their own reporters" of
their own exploits. Having delivered their message, they disappeared
as mysteriously as they came; for the legend loses sight of them in a
horse-trough near the temple of Vesta. Hither they repaired to water
their steeds, and to refresh themselves at an adjacent well; and those
who feel the insatiable thirst of curiosity, are referred to the bottom of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
this well for the truth, if a deeper inquiry into the legend is desired.
For many ages a superstitious reverence was shown for the margin of
the Lake Regillus, where a mark, said to be the impression of a celestial
horse's hoof, remained, to make a lasting impression on the softness of
credulity.</p>

<p>We have hitherto been swimming, as well as we can, in the sea of
conjecture, catching eagerly at the lightest cork or bladder, in the shape
of fact, to keep us afloat in the stream of events flowing from legendary
sources.</p>

<p>The continuation of the journey will be chiefly on the <i>terra firma</i> of
fact; and, instead of being, now and then, so thoroughly at sea as to
find ourselves wandering into the wildest latitudes, with no other pilot
than tradition, we shall henceforth, in our progress, have good and
substantial grounds to go upon. Hitherto we have had credulity
pulling at the oars, the idle and uncertain breezes of rumour filling our
sails, and our rudder in the hands of various authorities distinguished
for nothing but their disagreement with each other, and who would, in
fact, be without distinction of any kind if they were without a difference.</p>

<p>We are now about to pursue our journey by a more certain road, to
carry on our history, as it were, by the rail; and, though the line may
be a peculiar one of our own, the train of facts will be regular, coming,
we trust into no violent collision with others pursuing the same path,
and arriving, in due time, at the appointed terminus.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>FROM THE BATTLE OF THE LAKE REGILLUS TO THE CLOSE OF THE<br />
WAR WITH THE VOLSCIANS.<br /><br /></h3>

</div>
<p><span class="smcap">he</span> resources of Rome had hitherto
been derived from the plunder
taken in war, but the field of battle
is always far less fertile than the
field of industry. In the former
case, the crop once gathered is
rendered for ever unproductive,
and to beat the same enemy twice
over, is like the useless operation
of thrashing straw; for if, in either
case, the first thrashing has been
complete, there is nothing to be
got by a second. The plebeians
had been so long withdrawn from
the cultivation of the land, that
they found it extremely awkward
to cultivate a second time an
acquaintance once dropped; and
the earth having been hitherto
regarded as <i>infra dig.</i>, was not
likely to yield much to those who had despised until they wanted it.
The plebeians could only reap what they had sown, and as they had
sown nothing of any value, they had fallen into a state of extreme
seediness. Begging and borrowing were the only alternatives of those
who could no longer steal, and the patrician body became a sort of loan
society to the plebeians, who pledged themselves not only morally, but
physically, for the return of the money that had been advanced to them.
The law of debtor and creditor was extremely stringent in ancient Rome;
and indeed its stringency amounted almost to a rope round the debtor's
neck; for if he could not pay within a certain time, he was tied down as
the slave of his creditor. In this position the assailant was called an
<i>addictus</i>, for he was regularly sold, without even the equity of redemption
being allowed to him. If the borrower had only pledged himself
without an actual sale, he was simply a <i>nexus</i>, with the power of paying
off his debt by either money or work; but if he could do neither, he
became an <i>addictus</i><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> forthwith, when he was thrown into chains, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
wore nothing but the stripes, which were the ordinary livery of that
disgraceful state of servitude.</p>

<p>Appius Claudius had been chosen Consul, with P. Servilius as a
colleague, in the year of the City 258, when a miserable old insolvent,
with his hair like a mat, giving evidence of the severe rubs that had
fallen on his head, rushed into the forum. His face had the paleness
of ashes, and many tried to sift his countenance, in which the marks of
his having been ground down to the dust were plainly visible. His
back bore traces of recent scores, every one of which he declared should
be accounted as a score to be paid off upon his oppressors. His farm
had been burned down, and its contents burned up; his cattle had been
driven he knew not where, while he himself had been driven to distraction.
The tax-gatherer had, nevertheless, been as punctual as ever in
his calls, and having soundly rated the ruined agriculturist for not being
ready with his rates, the latter had been compelled to run into debt;
for the Romans had not made insurance against fire any feature of their
policy. Having been unable to pay his debts, the impoverished farmer
became the slave of his creditor; and the shoulders of the former bore
unmistakeable marks of the latter having got the whip-hand of him.
The excitement in the forum was intense; for all were seized with indignation,
who might possibly be seized for debt; and every one who
owed anything to anybody began to feel that he owed a great deal more
to common humanity. A popular outbreak seemed to be close at hand,
and the two Consuls consulted together on the crisis. Appius Claudius
gave it as his opinion, that as the people were put up, the best way was
to put them down; but his colleague, Servilius, was an advocate for a
milder regimen. At this juncture, news arrived of the Volscian army
having set out for Rome; and the plebeians being called upon to enlist,
declared that they would not enlist themselves at the bidding of those
who would do nothing to enlist their sympathies. In this difficult
dilemma, P. Servilius promised that if they would come out and fight,
they should be released from prison during the war; and guaranteed
that if they would present a bold front to the enemy's sword, their
backs should be safe from the scourge of domestic tyranny. There was
an immediate rush of insolvents into the ranks, which were soon filled
almost to overflowing; for as a great majority of the population
happened to be hopelessly in debt, a summons to the field was the
only sort of summons their appearance to which might have been
reasonably relied upon.</p>

<p>They fought with the energy of desperation, for each rank had sworn
an oath, and there was an affidavit, therefore, on every file, to do
execution on the Volscians. Never were bankrupts more determined
to avoid a surrender than the band of defaulters who went forth to
meet the foe with a confidence, which would, probably, have disappeared
had they recognised at the meeting a single one of their creditors.
The success of the Romans was complete, and those who had fought
upon the understanding that every blow they struck was to wipe out a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
debt, returned home in the expectation that every old liability had been
rubbed off, and that they would be free to rub on as they best could for
the future. They were, however, doomed to bitter disappointment, for
Appius Claudius declared that no faith ought to be kept with those who
had kept no faith with their creditors; and all the debtors who were not
prepared to pay upon the nail had the screw cruelly applied to them.
The debtors were sent back to their prisons, and many an unfortunate
insolvent, as he thought of the imposition that had been practised upon
him, could only cast his eyes upon the walls of his dungeon, and
murmur at the dreadful cell of which he had become the victim. The
bolts and bars of oppression would have brought liberty to a dead lock,
had it not been for the people outside the gaols, who threatened to rise
for the purpose of falling upon the tyrants. At this critical period
Rome was menaced by the Sabines, when the plebeians were called upon
to enlist; but they declared they would be recruits of the very rawest
description if they allowed themselves to be again done as they had been
already. Public meetings were held on the Esquiline and Aventine
hills, where liberal sentiments, which have now become as old as the hills
themselves, fell upon the popular ear with all the charm and force of
novelty. The patricians were divided as to the best means of dealing
with the difficulty their own misconduct had created, and it was obvious
that the fatal error having been committed of refusing to accede to a
just demand, the scarcely less dangerous mistake of yielding to violence
and clamour was the only course that could now be followed. The
patricians would have stood by their order; but the difficulty was to
know how public order, as well as their own order, could be preserved;
and it was at length agreed that a dictator should be appointed. The
choice fell upon M. Valerius, a moderate man, whom the plebeians could
trust, for he came of a good stock, his father being no other than that
great gun of the popular party, the famous Publicola. A large army
was soon ready to take the field, or to take anything else that came in
the ordinary course of battle. Valerius marched against the Sabines,
who fled, or, more literally speaking, decamped; for they left behind
them their camp, which was taken by the enemy.</p>

<p>On his return to Rome in triumph, the dictator asked for an inquiry
into the people's wrongs, with a view to giving them their rights; but
the patrician party in the senate refusing him his committee, Valerius
sent in his resignation, which was accepted by the senate. He
apologised to the plebeians for not having been able to carry his measures
of reform; and the patricians, pleased by his moderation in resigning
his seat, gave him a curule chair&mdash;a sort of portable stall, or reserved
seat, which, at the Circensian games he was privileged to occupy.</p>

<p>The Curule Chair, or Sella Curulis, invites us to pause for a moment,
and hold a short sitting upon it, for the purpose of inquiring into its
origin. Comfort seems to have been supplied most charily in the
construction of this official chair; but there was a fine touch of
morality in giving uneasiness to the seat of unlimited power. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
legs of the Sella Curulis folded like those of a camp-stool; a device
which may have been emblematical of the fact, that the dictatorial
office was liable to a speedy shutting up, for the appointment was
never more than of six months' duration. The material of which the
chair was formed was the smoothest and most highly-polished ivory;
so that the fatal facility of a fall must have been frequently suggested
to the occupant of the seat by its exceedingly slippery surface.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The Consuls, fearing an outbreak if the army was disbanded, ordered
the soldiers to remain on duty in the capacity of special constables
over each other&mdash;the staff being held responsible for the conduct of the
main body. To be continued thus as a standing army, was more than
the troops felt disposed to stand; and, determining to take high
ground, they withdrew to the top of the Mons Sacer or Sacred Mount,
in the neighbourhood of Crustumenium. Electing L. Sicinius as their
leader, they accommodated themselves as well as they could, until
matters should be accommodated with the senate.</p>

<p>The patricians began to be greatly alarmed at the secession of the
plebeians; for though the former had been accustomed to trample the
latter under foot, all the foundations of society seemed to be withdrawn
in the absence of that part which, though it may be called the base, is
essential to the existence of the capital. Rome, in fact, was beginning
to find out that an aristocracy cut off from all connection with the
people at large, is little better than a flower separated from the tree,
and doomed to fall speedily into bad odour. The patrician order
happily recognised the important truth, that the most delicate tendrils
owe all their vitality to the sap, carried up to the top of the tree from
those portions that are in the closest connection with the soil; and
steps were therefore taken to prevent the final severing of the sturdy
trunk from the higher branches. An embassy, consisting of ten patricians,
was sent to negotiate; but as the patricians were no orators, and
their stupidity spoke for itself, Menenius Agrippa, who had once been
a plebeian, was sent as their head, which of course included their
mouth-piece.</p>

<p>Menenius, using his authority as spokesman for the common weal,
cited the fable of the Belly and the Members, to the bellicose <i>plebs</i>,
who seemed struck by his relation of it to them, and its own relation to
their existing position. He told them that, once upon a time, all the
members of the human body resolved on aiming a blow at the stomach,
which was accused of leading a life of idleness. The hands struck with
no particular aim; the legs, moved to rebellion, refused to stir; the
eye shut down its lid; the mouth went into open hostility, and the
nose joining in the general blow, there seemed every prospect that the
proud stomach would be glad to eat humble pie in the absence of all
other provisions. It was, however, soon found that, in nourishing their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
animosity, the members were keeping all nourishment from themselves,
and that they and their revenge were about equally wasted.</p>

<p>The plebeians, understanding the moral of the story, were disposed
to treat, on the understanding that they should henceforth be better
treated. An agreement was entered into, by which the sponge was to
be applied to all old debts; and all who had lost their liberty by being
the slaves of bad circumstances were restored to freedom. The new
compact provided also for the institution of two officers, named Tribunes,
who were invested with authority over the concerns of the plebeians;
and it was certainly one of the best investments ever made for the
profit of the Roman people. The person of the Tribune was so sacred,
that a common assault upon this officer, when in the execution of his
duty, rendered the assailant liable not merely to be taken up, but to be
knocked down and killed in the streets by any one having a mania for
manslaughter.</p>

<p>The Tribune was allowed such an unlimited liberty of speech, that
it was punishable to interrupt him; and in default of bail, it was death
to cough him down while addressing the people. Even to yawn
during one of his discourses, was to open an abyss into which the
yawner might be plunged before he was aware of it; and the involuntary
action of his distended jaws would often render them the jaws of
his own destruction.</p>

<p>The house of the Tribune was open day and night; so that it
was as easy to find one of these officers as it is in these days to
find a policeman, and sometimes rather easier. The Tribunes had
power to bring parties before them, or, in other words, to issue summonses,
as well as to enforce fines, which, if not paid, involved the
forfeiture of property, or, in simpler terms, were recoverable by distress
warrant upon the defaulter's goods and chattels. One of the greatest
privileges of the Tribunes was the right of exercising a veto on any
decree of the senate. Though they had no seats in the assembly, they
were permitted to look in at the door; and if any act was passing that
they disapproved, they had the privilege of exercising, by a shout of
"No," a sort of negative authority. This power of prevention left
fewer evils to be cured; and the plebeians, having at last obtained an
organ of their own, may be said to have found the key to their liberties.</p>

<p>The Tribunes seem to have had power to add to their number, for they
selected three colleagues, soon after they themselves had been chosen;
and, from this time forth, a struggle ensued between plebeian energy,
seeking its fair share of right, and patrician tenacity, holding on with
obstinate determination to exclusive advantages.</p>

<p>Contemporaneously with the institution of the Tribunes, some new
officers were appointed, under the name of Ædiles, who were something
like our Commissioners of Woods and Forests, of Sewers, and of Paving
combined; for they had the care of public buildings, roads, and drains,
as well as of baths and washhouses. They sometimes decided small
disputes, and acted as Inspectors of Markets, examining weights, settling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
quarrels, and holding the scales of justice as well as of merchandise.
They kept an eye to unwholesome provisions, and a nose to stale fish;
their ears took cognisance of bad language; in their hands they carried
a staff; and they were, in fact, a curious compound of the beadle, the
commissioner, the policeman, and the magistrate.</p>

<p>While the plebeians had been sulking on the Mons Sacer, a treaty
between the Latins and the Romans had been brought about by
Spurius Cassius, a Consul, who, though his name sounds like counterfeit
coin, seems to have possessed a good deal of the true metal. By
the treaty, both nations were to be almost entirely equal in every
respect; and, even with regard to booty, they were to be on the same
footing.</p>

<p>By another clause in the act, those insolvent debtors who had been
converted into "alarming sacrifices!" and were reduced to slavery,
because their creditors "must have cash," or its equivalent, were
restored to freedom. The ceremony of manumission was curious, and
comprised so many indignities done to the slave, that, although
free, he could not have been very easy under the process. He
was first taken before the Consul by his master, who gave him a
blow on the cheek, which was rather a back-handed mode of making
an independent man of him. The Consul then laid his wand about the
insolvent's back, at the same time declaring him perfectly free, and
telling him to go about his business&mdash;if he happened to have any.
The beating having been gone through, there was still more lathering
to be endured; for the head of the freedman was closely shaved, as a
precaution, perhaps, against his going mad on the attainment of his
liberty. His release from his chains was not complete until he had
been deprived of his locks; and to crown all, he was invested with
that emblem of butchery in a political, as well as a social point of view,
the red cap of liberty.</p>

<p>During the internal quarrels of Rome, agriculture had been so
thoroughly neglected, that the harvest had completely fallen to the
ground, or, rather, had never come out of it. The husbandman had
husbanded nothing, either for himself or others; and as nothing had
been sown but civil dissension, there was nothing to reap but the fruit
of it. The Romans, who, until lately, had been thirsting for power,
were now hungry for food; and, to prevent the people from dying at
home, envoys were sent to scour the surrounding countries,&mdash;a process
which involved many a brush with the inhabitants. It is stated, by
some historians, that, during the famine, an order was forwarded to
Gelo, of Syracuse, for corn, which that individual was quite ready to
supply, but for which he was so thoroughly unbusiness-like as to refuse
the money. The incident, though utterly without commercial interest,
would have been pleasing in a different point of view, were it not for
the stern realities of chronology, which prove that Gelo could not have
acted as a gratuitous corn-dealer at the time specified, for he was not
alive at the period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
While Rome was suffering from want of corn, it was wasting the
very flower of its population in a war with the Volscians. Among the
most distinguished warriors on the side of the Romans was Caius
Marcius, a young patrician, who led all his own clients into an action
in which the defendants&mdash;the unfortunate Volscians&mdash;were subjected to
enormous damages. He subsequently proceeded against Corioli, which
made an obstinate defence; but was ultimately beaten, and compelled
to pay the whole of the costs of the conflict. From this affair he took
the name of Coriolanus, by which he is better known than by his original
appellation of C. Marcius, for mankind will too often award the largest
measure of fame to the most extensive perpetrator of mischief; and he
who would carve himself a name, may carve it much more deeply and
durably with the sword than with any other instrument.</p>

<p>When the corn arrived from Sicily, the popular party proposed a
gratuitous distribution of the boon; but the patricians, headed by Coriolanus,
who was a tyrant in grain, recommended that the plebeians
should pay for what they required. Complaint is never so open-mouthed
as when it has nothing to eat; and the people became desperate when
they found Coriolanus advising, without a scruple, that not a grain should
be given, nor an ear lent to their sufferings. He proposed the abolition
of the Tribunes as the condition of food being supplied to the people;
but they, becoming every day more crusty from the want of bread,
insisted on his being tried for treason. Coriolanus saw the people waxing
resolute to seal his doom, and he accordingly made his escape, so that
when the time came for him to be tried, he was found wanting. Judgment
went against him by default; his name was struck out of the list
of patricians&mdash;a sort of peerage of the period. He was sentenced, moreover,
to <i>aquæ et ignis interdictio</i>&mdash;prohibition from fire and water; a
punishment which, looking at the fiery nature of all spirituous liquors,
may be fancifully supposed to have involved especially a stoppage of
grog, as it certainly prevented everybody from entertaining him. This
sentence amounted, in fact, to banishment; and, indeed, it was designed
to do so; for the interdiction of fire and water left the culprit nothing
on earth but air, which of course it was quite impossible to <a name="live_upon" id="live_upon"></a>live upon.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Coriolanus parting from his Wife and Family.</span><br /><br />
</div>

<p>Stung with what he called the ingratitude of his countrymen, though
they had really not much to thank him for, Coriolanus, in a spirit not
very magnanimous, proceeded to offer his services to the enemy. Taking
leave of his wife Volumnia, a voluminous woman, who had had greatness
thrust upon her by nature to an awkward extent, he departed for
the country of the Volscians, and arrived at Antium about supper time.
His name was taken up at once to Attius Tullius, who, though sitting
at his meal with the usual accompaniment of <i>manus unctæ</i>, or greasy
hands, determined not to allow the illustrious stranger to slip through
his fingers. Coriolanus was hospitably entertained, and induced to
take the command of the Volscian army against the Roman colonists.
He drove them from place to place until he had got them up against the
Cluilian ditch, and into it many were thrown; a sad proof of his animosity
having been carried to a pitch that must always leave a black stain on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
his memory. Here also he pitched his tent within almost a stone's
throw of Rome; and as the plebeians were unwilling to fight, ambassadors
were sent to entreat Coriolanus to lay down his sword; but, contemptuously
folding his arms, he returned no answer. The priests next
tried their powers of persuasion, but though they did all they could
to convert Coriolanus to the cause of Rome, it was not until female
influence was brought into requisition, that the attempt proved successful.
His mother Veturia, accompanied by his considerably better
half, Volumnia, and a party of Roman ladies made up for the occasion,
visited him at his camp, when the clamour of the strong-minded, the
sighs and sobs of the weaker, the sneers of some, the tears of others,
and the importunity of all, proved irresistible. He had been resolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
for some time; but when his wife, with a heavy heart added to her
natural weight, fell upon his neck, he seemed to be sinking under that
which he could no longer stand up against.</p>

<p>His mother, Veturia, following up the advantage that had been
gained, tried the power of the female tongue, to which time seems to
go on adding all the force of which it deprives the rest of the body.
The old lady raved and shouted with a degree of anile energy that
struck Coriolanus with dismay; and when she threw herself on the
ground, declaring he should walk over her body if he attempted to
march upon Rome, he felt that he could not take another step without
trampling on the tenderest relations of humanity. With Volumnia
hanging to his neck, and Veturia clinging to his heels,&mdash;with a wife
pouring the loudest lamentations into his ear,&mdash;with a mother cursing
everything in general, but his own birthday in particular,&mdash;with a bevy
of Roman ladies shrieking and sobbing in the background,&mdash;Coriolanus
could no longer resist, but ordered his camp to be broken up, and led
his legions back again. Tradition differs as to the date of the death of
Coriolanus, who, according to some accounts, sunk under the attack
made upon him by the weaker sex; while others assert that he lived to
a good old age, which is likely to have been the case, if the scene we
have described was not immediately the death of him&mdash;for the constitution
that could have survived so severe a trial must have been of a
strength truly wonderful.</p>

<p>Coriolanus has been held up as a model of disinterestedness, but we
cannot help setting him down as a selfish upstart, who turned traitor to
his country, because it did not form the highest estimate of his personal
merits. His deserts are overbalanced by the fact of his being a deserter;
and it was, assuredly, the reverse of magnanimity to evince his spite
against the nation to which he belonged, merely because his own value
had not been put upon his own services. Such is our view of Coriolanus
without the masquerade dress in which he has been often made to appear;
for truth compels us to take off the gilt in which he has hitherto shone,
and to substitute the guilt that really belongs to him.</p>

<p>The Temple of Fortuna Muliebris was raised, in compliment to the
women who, by their hysterical, and now historical efforts, were said to
have saved Rome; and indeed, considering the frequency with which
female influence operates the other way, the fact of its having been
exercised for the prevention of mischief, deserves the commemoration of
a monument.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br />CHAPTER THE SEVENTH.</h2>

<h3>FROM THE CLOSE OF THE WAR WITH THE VOLSCIANS TO THE PASSING<br />
OF THE BILL OF TERENTILLUS.<br /><br /></h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 174px;">
<img src="images/i_p0065.png" width="174" height="200" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p><span style="margin-left:-1.5em;" class="smcap">fter</span> the war with the
Volscians was at an end,
the Romans are said to
have entered into a treaty
with their former foe, the
object of which was a
sort of partnership in
plunder; it being agreed
that the new allies should
take the field together,
and divide the produce.
Ill-gotten gain is never
a source of real profit;
and the land stolen in
war became a ground of
contention among the
Romans. The patricians
had hitherto grasped the
whole of the conquered
soil, though they could
not do so with clean hands; and Spurius Cassius proposed that the
plebeians should have a share of it. The suggestion, though violently
resisted, became the law of the land; but the land was not appropriated
in conformity with the law until a much later period. Spurius Cassius
did not long survive, when the year of his Consulship had expired; for
the patricians caused him to be impeached, and his head was struck off
upon a block, though, from the services he had performed, it deserved
rather to have been struck off upon a medal.</p>

<p>The patricians tried to divert the attention of the plebeians from
domestic affairs by leading them constantly into battle; but the latter,
though compelled to march into the field, would take no steps to secure
a victory. Like horses brought to the water but refusing to drink, the
soldiers, though conducted to the field, evinced no thirst for blood;
but firmly declining to aim a single blow, they presented a striking
picture of passive disobedience. In vain did the officers suggest, that
for those ambitious of a soldier's grave, there was at length an eligible
opening; they would gain no laurels, but allowed themselves to be
kept at bay; they laughed outright at their commanders, and, instead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
straining every nerve for success, they kept their risible muscles only
in full exercise.</p>

<p>There existed at this time a gens in Rome which had managed to
obtain such a share of power for itself, that it was generally recognised
as the governing family. The gens alluded to was that of the Fabii,
whose union formed their chief strength; for no member of the family,
though he might be unmindful of his antecedents, was ever known to
forget his relatives. The Fabii derived their name from Faba, a bean,
because their ancestors had cultivated that kind of pulse; but in later
times the gens became remarkable for feeling the popular pulse, and
making a cat's-paw of the patricians. By an arrangement with the
order to which they belonged, the Fabii were ensured one of the
consulships, on condition of their influencing their clients to elect a
patrician to the other; and thus both the people and the senate were
played off against each other for the special advantage of the "family."
Fortunately for society, there is in all corruption a rottenness which is
always bringing it towards its conclusion while it seems to be gaining
its end; and the usual difficulty of getting unprincipled men to hang long
together by a rope of sand, was illustrated in the case of the patricians
and the Fabii. The quarrels among themselves helped to render them
contemptible to the plebeians, and the troops had become so accustomed
to treat their leaders with disrespect, that many an intended fight ended
without a sword being taken from its sheath, and nothing was drawn
but the battle.</p>

<p>One of the Consuls had, for several years, been chosen from the family
of the Fabii; when its members growing tired, at last, of their patrician
stock being a laughing-stock to the army, determined to make themselves
popular. Marcus Fabius won the hearts of the soldiers, by
dressing their wounds, and promising to redress their grievances.
Kæso Fabius, his successor, recommended the distribution of the land
among the plebeians, by whose sweat it had been gained; but he had
not been always equally anxious to acknowledge the claims of popular
perspiration; for he had been one of those who condemned Spurius
Cassius for having made a similar proposition.</p>

<p>Tradition states that the Fabii afterwards emigrated in a body, upwards
of three hundred strong, taking with them four thousand clients; but
whether the clients went at their own solicitation, or whether the Fabii
were the solicitors, we are not in a position to determine. It is said
that the whole party of four thousand three hundred went into action
together, and paid with their lives the costs of the sad affair; but the
critical authorities doubt the whole story; and it is satisfactory to our
best feelings to know that we, on this point, know nothing.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The Etrurians soon after wasted the country near Rome, and wasted
their own time into the bargain, for they were at last glad to treat,
though not until they had retreated. A peace was concluded; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
parties held their peace for forty years,&mdash;or, at all events, if they
ever had words, they did not come to blows during that lengthened
period.</p>

<p>As some of the events recorded in this chapter arose out of the Roman
law of debtor and creditor, it may be just as well to include in this
account a few items of a commercial character. When a man ran into
debt, he was almost sure to be brought to a stand-still, for compound
interest continued to accrue so rapidly that there was no chance of
compounding with those to whom he owed money. Thirty days after a
debt being demanded, the defaulter was handed over to his creditor, and
bound with a cord, by way of accord and satisfaction; but, at the end of
sixty days, a crier, whose office was enough to make him shed tears,
advertised the insolvent for sale as a slave in the market-place. It is
not surprising that the plebeians should rise against their being put up
to this degrading auction, more particularly when the masters to whom
they were knocked down were in the habit of beating and cruelly ill-treating
them. The patricians laid violent hands, not only upon the
plebeians, but upon all the property of the State, assuming to the utmost
all its rights, and repudiating all its duties. They took as a matter of
right all the offices of state; and so complete was the seizure made
by the patricians of every thing in the shape of a Government situation,
that the name of the order which absorbed to itself all the good things
is to be traced in the modern word "patronage." The whole of the
profits of war went into the pockets of the upper class; and though the
plebeians drew the sword, the patricians drew whatever money was
to be obtained from the enemy.</p>

<p>The patricians, however, were not allowed to exercise their tyranny
always without resistance; for, if their conduct was revolting to human
nature, it was to be expected that human nature would revolt against
them when opportunity offered. An instance occurred during the
Consulship of Appius Claudius, who had been elected by the senate,
and who, wishing to levy troops, caused the names of all the men
between eighteen and forty-five to be called over in a list, which
furnished the materials for enlistment. Amongst the names was that
of Publilius Volero, who had formerly held a commission as a centurion,
or captain; and, being now selected to serve as a common soldier,
declared indignantly that rather than go as a private into the ranks,
he would continue in a private station. Publilius, in fact, kicked
violently against the orders of the Consul, and being a man of very
powerful stamp, it was felt that when Publilius kicked in earnest, there
was something on foot that it was not easy to contend against. Appius
intimating that the Consuls must be obeyed, desired one of the lictors
to do his duty; when Volero, being a strong and robust man, received
the lictor with open arms, and lifting him from the ground, gave him
a setting down that shook the nerves of the astonished officer. Having
thrown the lictor on the ground, where the unhappy functionary took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
his own measure, instead of carrying out those of his superiors, Volero
threw himself on the public, upon whom he made a very strong
impression.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_p0068.png" width="400" height="397" alt="A Lictor is sent to arrest Publilius Volero." title="" />
<span class="caption">A Lictor is sent to arrest Publilius Volero.</span><br /><br /></div>


<p>Publilius from this moment had considerable weight with the plebeians,
who made him one of their Tribunes; and he at once proposed
a large measure of reform in the mode of electing those officers. He
suggested an extension of the suffrage, by giving it to the tribes instead
of the centuries; and public meetings were got up in support of the
project. These meetings were attended by the patricians, and disturbances
ensued, owing to the attempts of one party to put the other
party down; for public discussion in all ages seems to have been
conducted on the principle that it is to be all on one side, and that any
opinion opposed to that of the majority is not to be listened to. When
the strength of lungs happens to be with the party having the strength
of argument, there is not much harm done; but as the patricians and
plebeians mustered in nearly equal numbers at the meetings alluded to,
personal altercations frequently took place; and the Tribunes as well as
the Consuls sent their respective officers to arrest each other.</p>

<p>At length Lætorius, who had been elected as the colleague of Publilius
Volero, marched into the Forum with an armed force, determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
that he would that morning carry the day; and as he drew his sword, he
declared he would go through with it. The patricians, losing their own
resolution, offered to agree to any that he might propose; but, refusing
to trust them, he took possession of the Capitol, as a guarantee for the
fulfilment of their promise. The <i>Lex Publilia</i> was accordingly passed,
to the great annoyance of Appius, who always treated the plebeians as
if different sorts of clay, as well as different moulds, were employed by
Nature in her great man&mdash;ufacture. When his year of office was over, he
was impeached by the Tribunes; but on the day when the trial ought
to have come on, the worldly trials of Appius were all past, for he died
the night before the cause stood for hearing. Posterity has agreed
on the verdict which the judges were not required to pronounce;
and it has even been said that he fell by his own hand, in consequence
of his sense of guilt preventing him from knowing how to acquit
himself.</p>

<p>To add to its troubles, Rome was visited by a double plague, in the
shape of an external foe and an internal pestilence. The enemy
having approached the gates of the city, the country people had taken
refuge inside the walls, bringing with them their cattle in such numbers
that the place was literally littered with pigs, while the oxen and sheep
were packed in pens to an extent of which our own pen can furnish but
a faint outline. The summer was at the height of its heat, and the
sufferings of the poor dumb animals, as they lost their fat, and met
their fate, were enough to melt not only a heart of stone, but many a
stone of suet. The foe, fearing from the pestilence a plaguy deal of
trouble, broke up their camp; and Rome was allowed to enjoy an
interval of peace, though disease did more havoc than might have been
expected at the hands of an enemy.</p>

<p>We now come to the legend of Cincinnatus; and though it is no better
than a legend, which, as the smallest student will be aware, is so called
from <i>legendum</i>, a thing to be read, we must proceed upon the assumption
that, as it is a thing to be read, it is <i>à fortiori</i> a thing to be written.
Lucius Quinctius, surnamed Cincinnatus from his curly locks&mdash;for nature
had dressed his hair to a turn&mdash;was of a high patrician family. He
passed his life as a country gentleman occupying his own estate, and
occupying himself in looking after it. His land, it must be admitted,
was better cultivated than his manners, which were haughty and imperious.
His virtues were all of the domestic kind; he was equally
attached to his wife and his farm, and he was an excellent husband, as
well as a good <a name="husbandman" id="husbandman"></a>husbandman.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_p0070.png" width="400" height="258" alt="Cincinnatus chosen Dictator." title="" />
<span class="caption">Cincinnatus chosen Dictator.</span><br /><br />
</div>

<p>It happened that Rome was in such a perilous state as to need a
strong hand, when Cincinnatus, being famed for the use of the spade, was
invited to leave his <i>otium cum dig.</i>&mdash;as everybody knows already, and
somebody may have said before&mdash;that he might assume the office of
dictator. When the messengers arrived from the senate, Cincinnatus
was at work in the fields, perhaps sowing up some old tares, or examining
the state of his pulse&mdash;a favourite crop in those days&mdash;or cutting out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the sickliest of his corn with the sickle. The soil being loamy, and
Cincinnatus being in the thick of his work, he was not very presentable;
but hastily throwing his toga round him, he made the best appearance
he could before the messengers of the senate. They at once hailed him
as dictator, and carried him to Rome, where he called out every man
capable of bearing arms; and every man thus called out, accepted the
patriotic challenge. Every soldier was to carry with him food for five
days, and twelve stakes cut into lengths to form a barricade; so that,
as the stakes weighed several pounds, and the eatables were solid, the
burden of each man, together with his accoutrements&mdash;which included a
cask on the head from which the perspiration poured&mdash;must have been
inconveniently ponderous. Notwithstanding their heavy load, the legend,
which is less weighty than their equipments, goes on to state that the
soldiers started at sunset, with Cincinnatus at their head, and reached
the camp, a distance of two-and-twenty miles, at a quick march, or rather
at a fast trot, by midnight. Though the story runs thus, we are compelled
to doubt the running of the troops, who, with their legs
encumbered by their arms and other equipments, must have found speed
impossible. On arriving at Mount Algidus, where the enemy was
encamped, Cincinnatus made his soldiers surround the place, and by
aiming at all in the ring, they were sure to hit somebody. Finding
themselves in the midst of a circle by no means social, the Æquians
sued for mercy; but Cincinnatus threw Gracchus Cl&#339;lius and his
lieutenants into chains, which was equivalent to making them enter
into bonds for their future good behaviour. Cl&#339;lius continued in his
command after having been thus formally tied down, and Cincinnatus
returned to Rome in triumph. Having held the dictatorship only sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
days, he laid it quietly down, and returning to his farming operations,
after having submitted the enemy to the yoke, he fitted it once
more to the necks of his oxen.</p>

<p>While engaged in fighting with an external enemy, a nation often
forgets the foes she has within; and it is the cruel policy of despotism
to waste the popular energy on quarrels with strangers, in order to
divert the attention of the public from domestic grievances. The war
being ended, the people began to look at home, and they soon perceived
that, while the sword of aggression had been in constant use, the sword
of justice had been rusting in the scabbard, or had been only drawn
forth to inflict, occasionally, a wound on public liberty. A movement
arose in favour of law reform, and C. Terentillus Arsa brought in a bill
for getting the patricians and plebeians to a better understanding, by
putting them on nearly the same footing. The measure led to considerable
agitation; for, though the tribunes passed it, the senate could
not get over it at all; and, the latter having thrown it out, the former
brought in a bill, containing a great deal more than the original demand,
in the year following. In political, as well as pecuniary affairs, a just
claim carries interest, which accumulates as long as the claim remains
unsatisfied; and every day, while it augments the debt due, increases
the difficulty of meeting it.</p>

<p>The proposition of Terentillus was much discussed in large assemblies,
the harmony of which was disturbed by some of the young
patricians; for, even in the early days of which we write, the noble art
of laughing down, or crowing over a discomfited orator, was understood
by some of the juvenile scions of aristocracy. It happened that
Cincinnatus had four sons, who were exceedingly fine young men, with
very coarse manners. One of them, named Kæso, was continually
getting into street rows, or disturbing public meetings; and frequently
went so far as to interfere with Virginius, a tribune, in the execution of
his duty. The officer was for a long time patient; but, at length, was
goaded to take the matter, as well as the offender, up; and Kæso was
charged with a series of assaults, of a more or less aggravated and
aggravating character. While these accusations were hanging over him,
an old case of manslaughter came to light; the victim having been an
aged invalid, whom Kæso, in a disreputable night brawl, had cruelly
maltreated. He was already under heavy sureties when this fresh
charge was brought up, and, to avoid meeting it, this proud patrician
ran away from his bail, leaving their recognizances to be forfeited.</p>

<p>Reports were soon afterwards spread, that the man who had left the
city as a contemptible runaway, was about to return to it in the more
formidable character of a robber and a murderer. One night when the
people had gone to bed, many of them heard in their sleep the trampling
of horses, which seemed to come like a tremendous nightmare over the
city. Presently a shout arose, which beat upon the drum of every ear
like a call to battle. The Consuls sprang out of bed, and throwing
about them the first substitute for a toga that the bedclothes presented,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
they made at once for the walls of the city. The plebeians, when called
upon, refused to serve; and the Consuls, feeling how weak they were
in going to the wall alone, made the usual promises, which the people,
as usual, were induced to discount, at a great personal sacrifice. Proceeding
to the Capitol, they found it in the possession of a large band
of exiles and runaway slaves, who would have been glad to run away a
second time, had escape been possible. Many fell, and were felled to
the earth, on both sides, while P. Valerius after putting several to the
sword, had the sword put to him in a most uncomfortable manner.</p>

<p>The exiles took nothing by their expedition as far as the attack was
concerned; but many of them owed something to the expedition with
which they fled from the contest. After this battle, all traces of Kæso
Quinctius are lost; but whether he fell in the fray, or whether the
thread of his existence was frayed out in some other way, is a mystery
we have no means of unravelling.</p>

<p>Appius Claudius was now called upon, as the surviving partner of
P. Valerius, to redeem the pledge given by the latter; but Appius, with
a chicanery worthy of Chancery in its best, or rather in its worst days,
pleaded the death of his colleague as a bar to the suit, declaring that
both consuls must be joined in it, though he knew all the while that a bill
of revivor for the purpose of including the deceased consul was quite
impossible. During these unhappy differences between the two orders,
many of the leading plebeians were murdered at the instigation of the
patricians, who, however, were rapidly cutting their own throats; for
violence, while it thinned the body, added to the stoutness of heart
of the popular party. The tribunes were increased in number from five
to ten; and, somewhat later, a still higher point was gained for the
plebeians by limiting to a couple of sheep and thirty beeves the fines to
which they were liable. These exactions were, however, enforced with
such rigour that the tenderest lamb was allowed no quarter if a fine had
been incurred, and the smallest stake in the country&mdash;if the stake
happened to be beef&mdash;was seized without remorse if the owner had
become subject to a penalty.</p>

<p>It was many years before the Bill of Terentillus&mdash;which has been
specially noted&mdash;was at length taken up, when the patricians graciously
consented to a change in the laws, and offered the benefit of their
services into the bargain, by taking upon themselves to determine the
sort of change that was required. Hitting, by anticipation, on the
modern expedient for delaying useful measures, the patricians appointed
a select committee to inquire into law reform, and, by way of rendering
the chances of legislation still more remote, they ordered the
members to proceed to Athens, where, under the enervating influence
of Attic associations, they were likely to go to sleep over the subject
of their labours. The special commissioners became, no doubt, so
thoroughly Greek in all their ideas, that, even the preparation of their
report was deferred until the Greek Kalends.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: -1em;" class="smcap">he</span> Romans, being at peace
abroad, began to think of
improving the means of
quarrelling among themselves
at home, and a desire
for law reform became general.
Three senators had
been sent to Athens to collect
information, but what
they picked up in
Greece was so thoroughly
Greek to
them, that they were
obliged to get it
translated into Latin
by one Hermodorus,
an Ephesian refugee,
before they could
understand a word of it.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> As one job naturally leads to another, it was
arranged that three commissioners having been employed in cramming,
the process of digesting should be entrusted to ten more, who were
called the Decemviri. These were appointed from the patricians, after a
struggle on the part of the plebeians to get five selected from their own
order; but, with a laudable regard to public order, they withdrew
their opposition. The especial object for which the Decemviri had been
appointed was to frame a new code of laws, but it seems to have been
always understood that the practical purpose of a commission is to delay
an object, quite as much as to further it. Lest the Decemviri should
proceed too rapidly with the work they had been specially chosen to do,
arrangements were made for distracting their attention from it by
throwing on them the whole business of Government. Had they been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
modern commissioners of inquiry, they would have needed no excuse for
delay; but, with a stubborn resolution to get through their task, they
surmounted, or avoided, the obstacles they might have been excused for
stumbling at. Instead of making their administrative duties an interruption
to their legislative labours, and urging the necessity for
attending to both as a plea for the performance of neither, the commissioners
took the sovereignty in rotation for five days at a time, and
as ten rulers acting all at once would have kept nothing straight, this
arrangement for obtaining the strength of unity was altogether a
judicious one. At the expiration of their year of office the Decemviri
had completed a system of laws, which was engraved on ten tables;&mdash;a
proof of the industry of the Government of the day, for in these
times it would be hopeless to expect ten tables from those who might
be, at the same time, forming a cabinet.</p>

<p>Though the Decemviri had done enough to win the public favour,
they had left enough undone to afford a pretext for the prolongation of
their powers. It was suggested that though the ten tables were very
good as far as they went, there was room for two more; and to give an
opportunity for this small sum in addition being completed, the continuance
of the decemviral form of government was agreed upon. As
the time for the election approached, the most disgraceful election
intrigues were practised, and in order to disqualify Appius Claudius&mdash;one
of the former Decemviri&mdash;the patricians put him in the chair, or
elected him president, on the day of the nomination of the candidates.
Appius had for some time been acting the character of the
"people's friend," and he had shown himself a consummate actor, for,
being a tyrant by nature, he must have been wholly indebted to art for
appearing otherwise. Having been called upon to preside, he opened
the business of the day by proposing nine names of little note&mdash;including
five plebeians&mdash;and then, with an air of frankness, he suggested himself
as a fit and proper person to complete the number. The people&mdash;surprised
and amused at the coolness of the proposition&mdash;proceeded to
elect the very candid candidate, who, being joined with a number of
nonentities, formed the unit to the ten of which the rest composed the
cipher. Soon after their election, the new Decemviri proceeded to complete
the twelve tables&mdash;and as they formed the origin of the Civil Law,
embodying principles which the best jurists have been unable to improve&mdash;we
will spread these tables before the student, and ask him to sit
down with us for a few moments over them.</p>

<p>We cannot promise him any other than a dry repast, with little or
nothing to whet his curiosity; and unless his appetite for information
is extremely vigorous, there will be little to suit his taste on those
plates of bronze or ivory&mdash;the material is immaterial, and has been
variously described&mdash;on which the provisions we are about to serve up
were originally carved.</p>

<p>The first table coincided in some respects with our County Courts
Act, and furnished a cheap mode of bringing a defendant into court by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
a simple summons, though if he refused to walk, a mule, an appropriate
type of obstinacy, was to be provided for him.</p>

<p>By the second table, it was justifiable to kill a thief in the night;
but a person robbed in the day was to have the thief as his slave;
a privilege equal to that of being allowed to take into your service, as
your page, the urchin who has just picked your pocket. Such an
exploit would no doubt indicate a smart lad, and, in order to make him
literally smart, the Roman law, in the spirit of our Juvenile Offenders
Act, ordered the knave a whipping.</p>

<p>The third table was in some respects an interest table; for it
prohibited the taking of more than 12 per cent. on a loan; but if a
debtor did not pay within thirty days, he might be bound with chains;
an arrangement by which his exertions to get out of difficulty must
have been grievously fettered. Having been made to enter into these
unprofitable bonds for sixty days, the debtor, if his creditors were
more than one, might have been divided between them; but human
nature must have found it difficult, under such circumstances, to declare
a dividend.</p>

<p>The fourth table seems hardly to have a sound leg to stand upon;
for it gave a father the right of life and death over all his children,
together with the privilege of selling them. To prevent a parent from
pursuing a disgraceful traffic in a series of alarming sacrifices of his
family stock, he was not permitted to sell the same child more than
three times over, when the infant was permitted to go into the market
on his own account, free of all filial duty.</p>

<p>The fifth table related to the estates of deceased persons; and if a
freedman died without a will or a direct heir, the law provided for the
distribution of his goods without providing for his family. Fallacious
hopes among poor relations were checked by handing over to the patron
all that remained; and thus the client may be said to have been subject
to costs, even after the debt of nature had been satisfied.</p>

<p>In the sixth table, there is nothing worthy of remark; but the
seventh guards against damage done by quadrupeds, and not only meets
the old familiar case of the donkey among the chickens, but declares
that any one wilfully treading on a neighbour's corn shall pay a suitable
penalty.</p>

<p>Agriculture was protected by making it a capital offence to blast by
incantation another's wheat; so that had the farmers of the day moaned
over each other's ruined prospects as they have done in more recent
times, performing a sort of incantation by singing the same old song of
despair, they might have been liable to lose their heads in the literal
as well as in the intellectual sense of which the phrase is susceptible.
By the same table, a man breaking another's limb was exposed to
retaliation; and a simple fracture was compensated by a simple fracture,
though the parties were allowed to compound if they preferred doing so.</p>

<p>The eighth table was equivalent to a Building Act; and by providing
a space of two feet and a half between house and house, it prevented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
collisions among neighbours; while the fruit dropping from one person's
tree into another's garden, fell by law into the hands of the latter.</p>

<p>The purity of justice was provided for by the ninth table, which
ordered the execution of a judge who accepted a bribe in the execution
of his office. It inflicted the same penalty on a corrupt arbitrator, or&mdash;that
greater traitor still&mdash;the wretch who should deliver up a Roman
citizen to the enemy.</p>

<p>The tenth table might teach a lesson to our own enlightened age, in
which it is too generally the custom to waste in hollow and costly ceremonies
over the dead, much that might be made serviceable to the
living. More than twenty centuries have passed since the Roman law-makers
seeing how mourners might be caught by the undertakers in
the traps and trappings of woe, limited to a certain sum the costs of a
funeral. The outlay upon the "infernal deities," to whom sacrifices
were made in those days, and to whom, therefore, we may compare the
black job-masters of our own time, was also reduced to the very lowest
figure. In measures of health the Romans were equally in advance of
us; for we still accumulate our dead in the grave-yards of our towns,
though by the laws of the twelve tables, burials within the city were
prohibited.</p>

<p>The eleventh and twelfth tables have come down to us in such mere
fragments, that it is difficult to make up an entire leaf from both of
them put together. To the eleventh, is attributed the aristocratic
provision against marriages between the patricians and the plebeians;
but as the law could not always prevent a flame, it was at last found
expedient to allow a match which was permitted five years later by the
Lex Canuleia.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Such is a brief account of the Laws of the Twelve Tables; which
although cut up by the shears of time into very little bits, say much,
in broken sentences, to the honour of their authors. Even as late as
the days of Cicero, it was a part of a boy's education to learn these
laws as a <i>carmen necessarium</i>&mdash;or necessary verse&mdash;though they were
not necessarily in verse at all; for the better opinion is, that they were
all in prose, and that they were, in fact, as free from rhyme as they
were full of reason.</p>

<p>The Decemvirs had now completed their allotted task; but, though
elected for a limited time, they seemed determined to remain in their
offices after their office hours were fairly over. During the first
Decemvirate the members had taken the Government alternately for
twenty-four hours at a time, on the principle of every lucky dog having his
day: but now the whole ten assumed, at once, the insignia of royalty.
Unable to resist the fascination of the fasces, the Decemvirs were each
of them preceded, when they walked abroad, by a bundle of those
imposing sticks; the sight of which, at last, aroused public attention to
the number of rods that might be in pickle for the backs of the people.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<p>Murmurs at home were echoed by rumours of war abroad; the
Æquians and Sabines had renewed their hostility; and the Decemvirs,
who could not levy troops or money, summoned the country gentlemen
from their seats out of town to their seats in the senate. Many
honourable members protested strongly against the Government, but
agreed to the necessary supplies; from which it seems that the practice
of speaking one way and voting another is a very ancient one. The
Decemvirs stuck to their places with an adhesiveness that might suggest
a comparison with Roman cement, but for the fact that the adhesiveness
is not uncommon in modern times, though the secret of the Roman
cement has perished. Armies were despatched to meet the foe, the people
having met the expenses, and Appius remained at home with one of his
colleagues. The Roman forces abroad had to contend with internal as
well as external enemies; for a venerable, but too garrulous soldier, one
Dentatus, called also Siccius, was constantly declaring himself heartily
sick of the tyranny of the Decemvirs. He had even talked of another
secession of the plebs; and, to prevent him from taking himself off, a
plan was formed to cut him off by a summary process. He received
orders from his superior officer to go up the country, with a few others, and
select a spot where a tent might be pitched, in the event of a pitched
battle. His companions were assassins in disguise, who, on arriving at
a lonely spot, threw off their masks, and appeared in their true features.
They immediately fell upon the astonished Dentatus; who must have
seen through his assailants before he died, for many were found
perforated with the sword of the veteran.</p>

<p>While the rest of the Decemvirs were disgusting the people by
their tyranny, Appius was proceeding to render himself one of those
objects of contempt at which not only the Roman nose, but the nose
of all humanity, was destined to turn up, and at which scorn was to
point her imperishable <a name="finger-post" id="finger-post"></a>finger-post.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Virginia carried off by a Minion in the pay of Appius.</span><br /><br />
</div>

<p>A centurion, named Virginius, had an only daughter, named Virginia,
whom her father, with a want of caution pardonable, perhaps, in a
widower, permitted to go backwards and forwards alone through the
public streets to a private day-school.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The young lady, in all the playful
innocence of sixteen, was in the habit of dancing and singing along the
thoroughfare, when the smallness of her feet, and the beauty of her voice,
struck the eye and ear of Appius. According to some authorities,
Virginia was attended by a nurse-maid; but it is scarcely necessary to
remark, that the same fatal fascination, which in military neighbourhoods
attracts female attention from children that ought to be, to men that are,
in arms, was no less powerful in the Via Sacra than in Rotten Row,&mdash;by
the banks of the Tiber, than on the shores of the Serpentine. One
morning, as Virginia was passing through the market-place, on her way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to the seminary, with her tablets and school-bag&mdash;or more familiarly
speaking, her slate and satchel&mdash;on her arm, a minion, under the
dominion of Appius, seized an opportunity for seizing the maiden by the
wrist. The nurse was either absent, or more probably talking to one
of the officers on duty round the corner; for the fasces were as irresistible
to the female servants of the day, as the honied words and
oilskin capes of a similar class of officials at a much later period.
Virginia screamed for assistance, and they only who have heard the cry
of a female in distress, can imagine the shrillness of the shriek that
rang through the market. Marcus&mdash;for such was the minion's name&mdash;was
instantly surrounded by a circle of respectable tradesmen, who knew
and desired to rescue Virginia. The smith, though he had other irons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
in the fire, left his bellows to deal Marcus a blow; the butcher, with
uplifted cleaver, was preparing a most extensive chop; and the money-changer
was just on the point of paying off the ruffian in a new kind of
coin, when he declared Virginia to be his slave, and announced himself
as the client of the dreaded Appius. At this formidable name, the
smith's work seemed to be done, the butcher became a senseless block,
and there was a sudden change in the note of the money-changer.</p>

<p>The officer on duty, who had arrested the attention of the nurse,
being at length called away by some trifling charge, had left her
at leisure to look after the more precious charge with which she had
been entrusted. As those usually talk the loudest who do the least,
the remonstrances of the female attendant were, no doubt, vehement
in proportion to her neglect; and, indeed, the confusion created by the
shrieks of the nurse was rather calculated to draw off the attention of
the crowd from Virginia herself, who was carried away by Marcus, with
an intimation that he should at once take the case before a magistrate.
Among the other consequences of the neglect of the maid, was an
attachment that had sprung up between the day-school miss and a
young gentleman, named Icilius. This impetuous youth, having heard
of what had happened, proceeded to the court at which the case was
about to come on, and which was presided over by the tyrant Appius.
Icilius prayed for an adjournment, on the ground of the absence of the
young lady's father; and it was found impossible to resist the application
of such an earnest solicitor. This point having been conceded,
the friends of Virginia applied for her admission to bail; and there was
such a general tender of securities among the throng, that Appius felt
he could not calculate on his own security if he refused the request
that had been made to him. The next morning the matter again came
on, in the shape of a remanded case; and Virginius, who had been on
duty with his regiment the day before, was now present at the hearing.</p>

<p>Had there been in those days the same love of the horrible that has
prevailed in our own times, the startling incident of a girl killed by her
own father, would have probably come down to us, through the medium
of the fullest reports, amplified by "other accounts," and a long succession
of "latest particulars." We must, however, on the present occasion,
be satisfied with the merest summary; for the Romans, in the
time of Appius, were equally destitute of relish for the details of the
spilling of blood, and of "family Sunday newspapers," whose respectable
proprietors are always ready to avail themselves of a sanguinary affair,
with an eagerness that seems to show that they look upon blood as
essential to the vitality of a journal, and involving the true theory of
the circulation. It remains only to be told, that Virginius, after taking
leave of his daughter, and finding her escape from the power of Appius
impossible, stabbed her with a knife, snatched up from a butcher's stall,
and, brandishing the weapon in the air, threatened perdition to the
tyrant. Appius, at the sight of the blood-stained steel, felt his heart
fluttering, as if affected by magnetic influence; and losing, for the time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
his own head, he offered ten thousand pounds of copper for that of
Virginius.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>It is the common characteristic of a moving spectacle to strike every
one motionless; and the guards of Appius, when ordered to seize Virginius,
found themselves fixed to the spot by so many stirring incidents.
In vain did Appius call upon his clients and his lictors to do their duty.
Among all his numerous attendants there was not a sole but shook in
its shoe, while the tyrant trembled from head to foot with bootless
anger. Urged at length by the commands of Appius, the officers
attempted to clear the spot, when a severe scuffle ensued, and
the authorities were assailed with all sorts of missiles. The market-place
supplied abundance of ammunition. Ducks and geese flew in all
directions. Some of the lictors found calves' heads suddenly lighting
on their shoulders. Others, who were treated, or rather maltreated,
with oysters, suffered severely from an incessant discharge of shells, and
many received the entire contents of a Roman feast, <i>ab ovo usque ad
malum</i>,&mdash;from the assault and battery of the egg, to the <i>malum in se</i>
of a well-aimed apple. The stalls of the dealers in vegetables were
speedily cleared of their contents; and a trembling lictor, smothered&mdash;like
a rabbit&mdash;in onions, might be seen, trying to creep away unperceived,
while others, who were receiving their desert in the form of
fresh fruit, fled, under a smart shower of grape, from the fury of the
populace. At length, the stock of the market being exhausted, the
assailants had recourse to stones; and Appius, feeling that he was
within a stone's throw of his life, entreated the lictors to remove him
from the scene of danger. Four of the stoutest of his attendants,
hoisting his curule chair on to their shoulders, made the best of their
way home, where Appius at length arrived, with the apple of his eye
damaged by a blow from a pear, his mouth choked with indignation and
mud, his lips blue with rage and grape juice, his robe caked with confectionary,
and his head, which had been made spongy with the loaves
thrown at it, affected with a sort of drunken roll.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Such is the melancholy
portrait which historical truth compels us to draw of the unhappy
Appius, for whom, however, no pity can be felt, even though his case
and his countenance presented many very sad features. The assault in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the market-place must have rendered it difficult for an artist of the day
to have taken his likeness, after the carrots, whirling about his head,
had settled in his hair, the rich oils having given to his Roman nose a
touch of grease, and the eggs thrown by the populace, who continued to
egg each other on, having lengthened his round cheeks into an oval
<a name="countenance" id="countenance"></a>countenance.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption"><i>Appius Claudius punished by the People.</i></span><br /><br />
</div>

<p>Having gained his palace, the wretched tyrant ran up stairs, in the
hope that he might save himself by such a flight; but he was overtaken,
and thrown into gaol, where he, who had hitherto been permitted to do
precisely as he pleased, was allowed just rope enough to hang himself;
a process, it is believed, he performed, though the subject is so knotty,
that we are not prepared to disentangle it.</p>

<p>Virginius had returned to the camp, where the soldiers, having heard
of the fall of the decemvir, proceeded to hit him, as usual, when down,
renouncing the authority of Appius and his colleagues. The valour of
the insurgents was, however, of a negative kind; for in times of danger
they seemed to think absence of body better than presence of mind, and
their policy was to secede from the city. They withdrew to the Sacred
Mount, where ambassadors from the Senate were sent after them, to see
if matters might not be arranged; when the popular chiefs, with a sort
of one-sided liberality, in which some friends of freedom are too apt to
indulge, asked an amnesty for themselves, and the immediate putting to
death of the whole of the late government. The ambassadors, not
liking a precedent, which might be applied to succeeding administrations,
of which themselves might form a part, suggested the propriety of
trying the decemvirs first, and executing them, if necessary, afterwards.
It was some time before the friends of freedom and justice could bring
themselves to consent to the trial preceding the punishment; but upon
being assured that the decemvirs would have little chance of escape, it
was at length agreed to allow them the preliminary forms of a trial.</p>

<p>The plebeians having got the upper hand, became almost as intolerant
as the tyrants they had displaced,&mdash;a common error, unfortunately,
among the professing lovers of liberty. They demanded that the
Tribunes should be restored, which was well enough; that the Tribunate
should be perpetual,&mdash;which was an insolent and overbearing interference
with the will of any succeeding generation; and, by way of
climax, they required that any one suggesting the abolition of their
favourite office should be burnt as a traitor. They were no doubt
fully justified in having a will of their own, but they had no authority to
entail that will upon a subsequent age; and least of all had they the
right to make bonfires of those who were of a different way of thinking.
It is true that, at such a moment, few are willing to put their lives
literally at stake, by uttering their opinions; but these arbitrary pranks,
so frequently committed in the name of freedom, account sufficiently for
the frequent use of the words "more free than welcome." The truth
is, that when Liberty becomes a notorious public character, she seems
to disappear from private life; and, indeed, how is she to be found at
home, if she is occupied out of doors, knocking off the hats of those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
will not give her a cheer, or breaking the windows of those who will not
illuminate in her honour?</p>

<p>The plebeians having gained the permission of the Senate to hang
and burn to their hearts' content all who might give way to difference of
opinion, under the weak-minded impression that it would never alter
friendship, proceeded to the election of Tribunes in place of the Decemvirs,
who were thrown into prison. This is said to have been the first
instance of the incarceration of any one belonging to the patrician order;
and the sensation in the upper circles was immense when they heard
that a few exclusives of their own set were in actual custody. Some
aristocratic families went into mourning on the melancholy occasion, and
offered any fine, as a matter of course, for the release of their kindred.</p>

<p>Appius Claudius and Spurius Appius&mdash;probably an illegitimate
member of the family&mdash;were thrown into the same cell, where, it is
said, they made away with themselves or each other; but whether there
is any truth in this story of the cell, or whether it is merely a cellular
tissue of falsehood, it is difficult to decide, after so long an interval.
The eight remaining Decemviri went into exile, or, in other words, were
transported for life; while Marcus Claudius, who had claimed Virginia,
repaired to Tibur, now Tivoli, and may be said to have taken his
conscience out to wash in the famous baths of the neighbourhood.
Other authorities say that he fled to avoid the ironing for life with
which he had been threatened, or that he feared the mangling to which
he might be exposed at home, at the hands of the infuriated populace.</p>

<p>Consuls had already been elected, in the persons of L. Valerius and
M. Horatius; but ten Tribunes were now chosen, among whom, of
course, were the leaders in the revolution; for it is a popular notion,
that those who have overthrown one government, must necessarily be
the fittest persons to construct another. It is, however, much easier to
knock down than to build up; and those who have shown themselves
extremely clever at bowling out, are often bowled out rapidly in turn,
when they get their innings.</p>

<p>It is a characteristic of nations, as well as of individuals, that those
who have no affairs of their own immediately on hand, are apt to concern
themselves with the affairs of their neighbours. The Romans having
arranged matters among themselves, began to look abroad, and having
rid themselves of domestic foes, they sent their Consuls, L. Valerius
and M. Horatius, to deal with foreign enemies. Valerius seized upon the
camp of the Æqui, just as they were canvassing their prospects under
their tents; and Horatius, after routing the Sabines, made them free of
the city; thus converting into respectable tradesmen those who had
been hitherto extremely troublesome customers.</p>

<p>When the Consuls returned to Rome, they expected the Senate
would pay them the usual compliment of a triumph; and instead of
entering the city at once, they put up at the temple of Bellona, outside
the walls, waiting for orders. The patricians, who were jealous of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
generals, thought to deprive them of the customary honours, by a low
trick; but the tribes dealing more fairly with the warriors, or, to use a
familiar expression, lending them a hand, decreed the triumph which
the Senate had denied to them. Thus did the patricians lose a privilege
they had abused; and the two Consuls drove four-in-hand into the city
in spite of them.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">In the foreground of the Tableau may be observed a Patrician looking very black at the
Triumph of the General.</span><br /><br />
</div>

<p>In modern times, the nearest approach we have to a triumph is the
entrance into a country town of a company of equestrians, or a travelling
menagerie. The arrangements were in many respects suitable to a
fair, and it would seem to have been the opinion of the Romans that
none but the brave deserved the fair, for it was only the most eminent
warriors who were awarded the honours of a triumph. There was,
however, something very undignified in the practice of hanging about
the outskirts of the town until regularly called in, which was the usual
course adopted by those who anticipated the glory of a summons from
the senate. It sometimes happened that the summons never arrived,
and the General, who had hoped to make his entry in a chariot and
four, was at last compelled to sneak, unattended, into the city. Such
might have been the lot of L. Valerius and M. Horatius, had it not
been for their popularity, aided, probably, by the senseless love of show,
which often causes the hero to be degraded into the mountebank. As
triumphs, like Lord Mayors' shows, were nearly all the same, the following
account will comprehend, or lead the reader to comprehend, the
general features of these military pageants.</p>

<p>The procession opened with a band of trumpeters, and as much
breath as possible was blown out of the whole body. Next came
some men with boards, inscribed with numerous achievements, and
forming, in fact, the posting bills, or puffing placards, of the principal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
character. These were followed by a variety of objects, taken from the
enemy, and may be compared to the properties used in the show, the
next feature of which was a file of flute-players, who walked in a sort of
fluted column. Next in order came the white bulls, or oxen devoted
for sacrifice, accompanied by the slaughtering priests, or holy butchers;
and immediately afterwards a remarkable beast, odd fish, or strange
bird, that had been snared, hooked, or caged, in the conquered country.
These were followed by the arms of the foe, with as many captives as
possible, in chains, and the larger the string of fettered victims, so
much the greater was the amount of "linked sweetness, long drawn out"
before the eye of the conqueror. After these were carried the gifts the
General had received from allied or friendly powers, consisting usually
of crowns made of grass, every blade of which was a tribute to the
sword of the victor. Next came a file of lictors, and then the General
himself, in a chariot and four, with a slave on the footboard behind,
whispering in his ear, to remind him of his being still "a man and a
brother."<br /><br /></p>

<p>The Consuls having gained a civil as well as a military triumph, by
their defeat of the patricians, would have been re-elected by acclamation
for another year; but they had the good sense to retire upon the popularity
they had gained, without waiting to become bankrupt of that very
fleeting commodity. The patricians, getting tired of an exclusiveness
which seemed likely to exclude them from real power, condescended to
vie with the plebeians as candidates for the office of Tribune. They
judiciously came to the conclusion that it was better to cast their pride
under foot, than to stand too much upon their dignity; and the result
was, that, by the election of two of their order, they obtained a voice in
the new government.</p>

<p>Popular measures were now the order of the day; and C. Canuleius,
one of the tribunes, brought in a bill to legalise the connubium
between the Patres and the Plebs, so that the fathers of the senate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
might marry the daughters of the people. This proposition for an
enlargement of the connubial noose gave rise to several very knotty
points, and to much opposition on the part of the patricians. The
greater number of them believed themselves to be the essence of all
that was rare and refined, until the more sensible portion of them
perceived that the essence was growing rarer every day, and that unless
it formed a combination with something more solid, it would all very
soon evaporate. The law was accordingly allowed to pass; and by the
timely application of some common clay, the roots of aristocracy were
saved from the decay that had threatened them. Many of the
patricians, who had long been wedded to old prejudices, found it far
more agreeable to be married to young plebeians; and matrimony was
contracted, or, rather, greatly extended, among the different classes of
society.</p>

<p>The Reform party had now become strong enough to propose that
one of the consuls should always be a plebeian; and though the Senate
tried very hard to maintain the principle, that those only are fit for a
snug place who have been qualified by a good birth, the tide of opinion
had set in so strongly the other way, that it was hopeless, with the
thickest sculls, to pull against the current.</p>

<p><i>Tribuni militum</i>, with the power of consuls, were instituted; but
the patricians managed, by a trick, to reduce these consuls into a sort
of stock for their own use, by selecting from their own body two officers
named Censors, who were to be employed in taking the census, an
extremely important part of the consular authority. The mere
enumeration of the people was not of itself a high privilege, and
required no acquaintance with the law, or of any of the twelve tables,
excepting, perhaps, the simple tables of arithmetic. Besides the
privilege of looking after the numbers of the people, the office gave
especial opportunities of looking after number one; for the administration
of the finances of the state was committed to the Censor;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and it has too
often happened that a collector of duties has considered that there was
a duty owing to himself, out of those received on behalf of the Government.
They were also Commissioners of the Property Tax, with full
inquisitorial powers; but, most odious part of all, they had authority
to ascertain the dates of the birth of females, as well as males, and
could mercilessly surcharge a lady for her age, as well as her husband
for his income. They were also controllers of virtue and morality, their
duty being to maintain the <i>mos majorum</i>, or manners of the old school;
for it seems to have been always the custom of mankind to lament the
past as "the good old times," no matter how bad the old times may
have been, and how infinitely inferior to the present.</p>

<p>The Censors, however, derived their chief influence from their power of
determining the rank of every citizen; for, from the very earliest times,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the multitude were in the habit of pursuing, through thick and thin,
that perilous Will o' the Wisp&mdash;a wisp that reduces many a man of
substance to a man of straw&mdash;a position in society. This the Censors
could award; and people were ready to pay any price for that most
costly of all stamps&mdash;though perhaps, after all, the most difficult to
purchase&mdash;the stamp of fashion. From the early days of Rome to the
present hour, we meet with frequent counterfeits of the stamp in
question, the forgery of which has spoiled, and continues to spoil, a
quantity of calves' skin, and asses' skin, that might otherwise be found
of service, at least to its owners.</p>

<p>Rome had begun to enjoy a short repose, like an infant in its cradle,
when it was unexpectedly made to rock to its very foundations, by a
shortness of provisions; for the absence of anything to eat is sure to
afford food to the disaffected. Grumbling is the peculiar attribute of an
empty stomach; and flatulence, caused by hunger, is an ill wind, that
blows good to nobody. During the scarcity, a wealthy citizen, one
Spurius Maelius, anxious to give his fellow-citizens a genuine meal,
purchased corn at his own expense, and sold it for a mere song&mdash;taking
the produce, perhaps, in promissory notes&mdash;to his poorer countrymen.
This liberality rendered Maelius extremely popular with all but the
patricians, who declared that they saw through his design in selling
cheap corn; that as old birds they were not to be caught with chaff:
and that his real aim was the kingly dignity. Under the pretext of
preventing him from accomplishing this object, the patricians appointed
a Dictator; and poor old Cincinnatus, bowed down with age and agriculture,
which had been his natural bent, was dragged from the tail of the
plough to the head of the state, though his own state was that of
extreme bodily decrepitude. His Master of the Horse, who really held
the reins, was Servilius Ahala, by whom Maelius was summoned before
the Dictator, to answer any charge that might be brought against him.
If the mode of making the accusation was strange, the method of
answering it was equally irregular; for Maelius, instead of meeting it
with dignity, ran away from it, with a butcher's knife, which he snatched
from a stall in the market-place. Flourishing the formidable weapon,
he cut in among the crowd, and was immediately followed by Servilius
Ahala, with a party of young patrician blades, who, in a manner that
would have pierced a heart of stone, plunged their swords into their
victim's bosom.</p>

<p>Ahala was charged with the murder, but he was enabled to avoid the
consequences, as men of consequence in those days could do, by a
voluntary exile. Though domestic cookery had received a check from
the dearth at home, there was no scarcity of foreign broils, and the
Romans created Mam. Æmilius dictator, to encounter the Fidenates
and Veientines. Three ambassadors were sent to Fidenae, but the
diplomatic service could not have been so desirable in those days as in
our own, for the three ambassadors were slain, and perhaps the financial
reformers would say that it was very proper to cut down such a piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of gross extravagance. The order emanated from Lar Tolumnius of
Veii; and while it said little for his heart, it cost him his head, which
was cut off by Cornelius Cossus&mdash;the master of the horse to Æmilius.</p>

<p>The Veientines continuing troublesome, Furius Camillus was appointed
dictator, when, with an engineering talent rare in those days,
he commenced a mine, and overcoming all minor, as well as major, or
general difficulties, he forced a way into the city. The King of Veii
was offering a sacrifice in the Temple of Juno, just as the Romans had
completed their tunnel, and as the soldiers burst like a crop of early
champions through the earth, he saw his fate written in bold Roman
characters. Everything was given to the conquerors, and it is said that
the statue of Juno, followed of its own accord; but the probability is,
the statue remained <i>in statu quo</i>, for miraculous instances of going
over to Rome were not in those days numerous.</p>

<p>Rome was once more at peace, when the citizens, with peculiar ingratitude,
having no other foes, began to quarrel with Camillus himself,
to whom they owed their tranquillity. They accused him of having
unduly trafficked in shares, by appropriating more than his due portion
of the booty. His unpopularity had not, however, come down upon him
until it was found that he had, in a fit of piety, dedicated a tenth of the
spoils of Veii to the Delphic God&mdash;a circumstance he had forgotten to
mention, until he had disposed of the whole of his own share of the prize,
and it became necessary for the other participators in the plunder to
redeem his promise at their own cost, and, with their own ready money,
to save his credit. His name fell at once from the highest premium of
praise to the lowest discount of disparagement, and he incurred the
especial detestation of those whom he had served; for kindnesses are
often written in marble in the hearts of those who remember them
only to repay them with ingratitude. Not liking to lie under the imputation
of dishonesty, and being unable to get over it, he chose a middle
course, and passed a sort of sentence of transportation upon himself by
going into voluntary exile. He, however, with a littleness of mind that
was not uncommon among the early Romans, vented his spite as he
left the city gate, expressing a wish that Rome might rue his absence;
but Rome consoled herself for the loss she might sustain in him by
confiscating the whole of his property.</p>

<p>Among the incidents of the life of Camillus, a story is told of an
event that happened, when, after having subdued the Veientines, he
drove the Faliscans out their city of Falerii. There existed within
the walls a fashionable boys' school, to which the patricians sent their
sons, who were frequently taken out walking in the suburbs. One
morning the pupils, who were two and two, found themselves growing
very tired one by one, for their promenade had been prolonged
unusually by the pedagogue. The wretch and his ushers had, in
fact, ushered the unsuspecting infants into the camp of Camillus, with
an intimation that the parents of the boys were immensely opulent, that
the schooling was regularly paid, and there could be no doubt that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
rich ransom could be procured for such a choice assemblage of fathers'
prides and mothers' darlings. Camillus nobly answered, that he did
not make war on young ideas not yet taught to shoot, and he concluded
by giving the schoolmaster a lesson; for, causing him to be stripped, and
putting a scourge into the hands of the boys, the young whipper-snappers
snapped many a whip on the back of their master.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>FROM THE TAKING OF ROME BY THE GAULS, TO ITS SUBSEQUENT<br />
PRESERVATION BY MANLIUS.<br /><br /></h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 128px;">

<span class="caption">A Gaul.</span>
</div>
<p>
<span style="margin-left:-1em;" class="smcap">s</span> a prophet is sure to come right
in the end, if he will go on prophesying
a thing until it really
happens; so the soothsayers, who
had been constantly predicting
the taking of Rome, seemed
likely, at last, to have their forebodings
verified.</p>

<p>The Gauls were destined to
be the invaders, and tradition
tells us that they were attracted
to cross the Alps by the reputation
of the Italian grapes, which
induced them to expect a superior
glass of wine on the other
side of the mountains. The Gauls
were remarkable for the hugeness
of their bodies, which presented
a series of gigantic pictures
in their iron frames; and
their faces being covered with
long shaggy hair, they seemed
ready, by their ferocious aspect,
to beard an enemy. These people
were the ancient inhabitants of modern France, and it is a curious
fact, that the occupants of the country have, up to the present time,
cultivated that hairiness of visage, in which they may be said to
have literally aped their ancestors. Tradition&mdash;that wholesale carrier,
who delivers so many parcels at the historian's door, some of which
are scarcely worth the carriage&mdash;has handed to us a small packet,
with reference to the Gauls and their origin, the contents of which
we proceed to examine. On taking it up, we find that it possesses
very little weight; but we, nevertheless, proceed to the operation of
unpacking. Beginning as we would with a basket, we find ourselves
hampered to a considerable extent, for on opening the lid, and using
the eye of discernment, we turn over the contents with eagerness,
and after all catch at little better than straw, in our attempts to
take hold of something tangible. Turning over the flimsy mass, we
arrive at very little of a solid description, though, on getting to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
bottom of it, we establish the fact that the Gauls, under Brennus, their
chief, marched upon Clusium, one of the states of Etruria. People in
difficulties are apt to grow exceedingly amiable towards those who are in a
position to help them; the man of money becomes the very "dear Sir"
of one who needs a loan, and the Clusians appealed to their "friends,"
the Romans, of whom they knew nothing, for their kind assistance.</p>

<p>The Roman Senate, adopting the quarrel of the Clusians, sent three
ambassadors, the sons of M. Fabius Ambustus, to the Gauls, desiring
them to withdraw; but the Gauls sent back a very galling answer. They
declared their own country was little, and their necessities were large;
that they had not land enough to supply them with bread; and, though
they wished not to tread on a neighbour's corn, they could not help
feeling where the shoe was pinching. They added, that, as to Clusium,
they did not want it all, but would willingly share it with its owners;
a proposition similar to that of a pickpocket, who, while robbing you of
your handkerchief, politely offers you the joint use of it.</p>

<p>This arrangement not having been acceded to, the Clusians and the
Gauls came into collision; when the Roman ambassadors, who only
went to have a few words, so far forgot their diplomatic character as to
come to blows; and, though it is not unusual for peace-makers to cause
more mischief than they prevent, it was rather too much to find the
pacificators, who had gone forth to knock discord on the head, engaged
in fracturing the skulls of those whom they went to propitiate. One of
the Fabii not only killed a Gallic chief, but, having made away with
the individual, was making off with his arms and accoutrements; when
a cry of "shame!" arose from the Gauls, who did not approve of an
arrangement by which the envoy was killing several of them, while a
delicate regard to the law of nations prevented them from killing the
envoy. It is difficult for men to stand upon a point of etiquette when
threatened with the point of the sword; but the Gauls, with extreme
moderation, resolved on sending envoys to complain of the envoys;
and thus, as it were, fight the ambassadors with their own weapons.
The Roman Senate felt the justice of the complaint; but, seeing that
public feeling ran the other way, the Senators were base enough to do
an injustice rather than make an honourable stand against the
wilfulness of the people.</p>

<p>The Fabii, whom the Senate had been too cowardly to punish, the
million thought proper to reward by appointing them Consular Tribunes
for the year ensuing; and when the news reached the Gauls, it excited
in them a very natural bitterness. After their first burst of rage, they
began to collect themselves; and finding, when collected, they could
muster 30,000 strong, they were joined by upwards of 40,000 Senones,
in alliance with whom they reached Allia, a little stream flowing
towards the Tiber. Here they were met by the Romans, who threw up
entrenchments to prevent the enemy from entrenching upon their
domain; but being comparatively few in numbers, they endeavoured to
spread themselves out as far apart as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
As a kettle of water thrown upon a spoonful of tea, with the intention
of making it go further, produces a weakening effect; so did the expansion
of the Roman line dilute its strength to such a degree, that the right
wing became panic-stricken, and the left catching the infection, both wings
began to fly together. Several of the Romans plunged into the Tiber,
to save their lives, and the dux or general set the ignominious example.
Some lost all self-possession, and fell helplessly into the possession of
the enemy; while others finding their heads beginning to swim violently
on shore, could not obtain the chance of safety by swimming across the
river.</p>

<p>A few only of the soldiers got home in safety, soaked to the skin;
and though there may be something ignoble in the picture of a party of
Roman warriors dripping in their wet clothes, we are compelled to
follow the dry threads of history. Those who escaped by means of the
friendly tide, took the sad tidings to Rome, which would now have
fallen an easy prey to the Gauls, had they not remained on the field of
battle, uttering horrid yells, shaking their yellow locks, and intoxicating
themselves with something more potent than the stream cup of success
which they had quaffed so easily. When the bad news reached Rome, the
citizens began to fly apace, and some were startled by their own shadows,
as if, like guilty creatures, they were unable to bear their own reflections.
Many of the patricians ran for safety into the Arx, or topmost part
of the city, which was carrying cowardice to the utmost height; and
some who tried to save their goods as well as their lives, packed their
property in casks with the hope of preserving it.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the Gauls, they found the walls and the inhabitants
completely unmanned, and though nearly every one who remained was
somebody beside himself, the population had, owing to the foolish panic,
been most sensibly diminished. Among those who remained were
eighty old patricians, who had filled in their turns, the chief offices of
state, and who, having sworn to die, took the oaths and their seats in
the Forum. They wore their official robes, occupied their ivory chairs,
and being carefully got up with venerable white beards, they had all
the imposing effect of a <i>tableau vivant</i> upon the Gauls who entered the
Forum. One of the barbarians, attracted by the singularity of the
scene, stroked the beard of the aged Papirius to ascertain if he was
real, when the aged P. having returned the salutation by a smart
stroke with his sceptre, the inquisitive Gaul found his head and the charm
broken together. Though the patricians had, at first, worn the
appearance of mere wax-work, they now began to wax warm, which led
to their speedy dissolution; for the Gauls, falling violently upon them,
converted the whole scene into a chamber of horrors. The eighty
senators were slain, to the immense satisfaction of the Romans themselves,
who felt a conviction that after this alarming sacrifice they were
sure of a triumph. They seemed to look upon the venerable victims
as so much old stock that must be cleared off, and the previously
depressed citizens began to rally with all the renewed vigour of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
bankrupt who has just undergone the operation of an extensive failure.
The Gauls invested the Capitol, but its defenders feeling that no one
had a right to invest that Capitol but themselves, did their utmost to
keep it standing in their own names; and, not even for the sake of
ensuring their own lives, would they agree to an unconditional surrender.
The barbarians, finding nothing better to do, commenced firing the city
in several parts, pulling down the walls and throwing them into the
Tiber; a species of sacking that must have been very injurious to the
bed of the river.</p>

<p>The occupants of the Capitol continued to hold out, or rather, to
keep in, and it being desirable to communicate with them, a bold
youth, named Pontius Cominius, attempted the hazardous enterprise.
Having encased himself in a suit of cork, he crossed the Tiber, and
clambering on his hands, he performed the wonderful feat of reaching
the Capitol. He returned in the same manner; and, on the following
day the Gauls observing the track, thought to be all fours with him,
by stealing up on the points of their fingers and the tips of their toes,
to the point he had arrived at. With a cat-like caution, which eluded
even the vigilance of the dogs, and while the sentinels were off their
guard, a party of the Gauls crept up one by one to the top of the rock,
which was the summit of their wishes. Just as they had effected their
object, a wakeful goose,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> with a head not unworthy of the sage,
commenced a vehement cackle, and the solo of one old bird was soon
followed by a full chorus from a score of others. Marcus Manlius, who
resided near the poultry, was so alarmed at the sound that he instantly
jumped out of his skin&mdash;for, in those days, a sheep's skin was the usual
bedding&mdash;and ran to the spot, where he caught hold of the first Gaul
he came to, and, giving him a smart push, the whole pack behind fell
like so many cards to the bottom.</p>

<p>Manlius was rewarded with the scarcest luxury the city contained, in
the shape of plenty to eat, and it cannot be said that we have greatly
improved upon the early Romans in matters of the same kind, for a
dinner is still a common mode of acknowledging the services of a public
man, and literally feeding his vanity.</p>

<p>The Gauls continued to invest Rome, and heard with savage delight
of the diminishing supplies, or rather, to use an Irishism, the increasing
scarcity. News at last came that the garrison had been for some time
living upon soles, and it is an admitted fact that they had consumed all
but a few remaining pairs belonging to the shoes of their generals.
Driven at length to desperation, they baked as hard as they could the
flour they still had on hand, and making it up into quarterns, or four
pounders, threw it at the enemy. The Gauls looked up with astonishment,
when another volley of crust satisfied them that bread was coming
"down again;" and not wishing to get their heads broken with the staff
of life, which they fancied must be very plentiful in Rome, they offered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
terms of ransom. The price fixed upon was one thousand pounds of
gold, in the weighing of which the Gauls are said to have used false
weights, but it is difficult to say what weight ought to be given to the
accusation. The story goes on to say that the Gallic king, on being
remonstrated with for his dishonesty, cut dissension short with his
sword, and throwing it into the scale with a cry of <i>Væ victis</i>, turned
the balance still more in his own favour.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">The Citadel saved by the cackling of the Geese.</span>
<br /><br /></div>

<p>In the meantime the Romans at Veii had called Camillus from exile,
and chosen him Dictator; for it was the opinion of the day that good
use could always be made of a man after thoroughly ill-using him.
Camillus arrived at Rome just as the gold was being weighed, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
declared that he would deliver his country, but would not allow the
delivery of the treasure. He added, that the metal with which all
claims upon Rome should be met was steel; that he cared not who
might draw upon him, for he was ready, at sight, with prompt acceptance.
While the discussion was proceeding, a Roman legion arrived;
and the Gauls were driven out of the city, having lost not only their
self-possession, but possession of the gold that had been assigned to
them. On the road to Gabii a battle ensued, in which every Gaul, it
is said, was slain, not one being left alive to tell the tale; and as
there are two sides of a story, as well as of a fight, it is impossible, in
the absence of the other party, to say which side was victorious.</p>

<p>When the Romans returned to their city, they found it little better
than a dust-heap, or a plot of ground on which a shooting party had
met for the purpose of shooting dry rubbish. The people were called
upon to rebuild their houses; but even in those days the principle of
the proverb, that fools build houses for wise men to live in, appears to
have been recognised. There was a general disinclination to dabble in
mortar; and there seemed to be a conspiracy not to enter upon a plot
for building purposes.</p>

<p>Rome seemed very unlikely to be built in that day; and it might
never have been restored, had not an accident&mdash;on which they put an
ominous construction&mdash;caused the citizens to proceed to the re-construction
of their city. While Camillus was "on his legs" in the senate, a
centurion, passing the House of Assembly with a flag in his hand, was
heard to say, "Let us plant our banner here, for this is the place for us
to stop at." The senators, rushing forth, declared their acceptance of
the omen, though there was nothing ominous in the fact; and the
people, carried away, or rather attracted to the spot, by the same
stupidly superstitious feeling, declared that on that place they would
rebuild the city. There is no doubt that the anxiety of the senators for
the restoration of Rome was owing to the fact of their own property
lying near at hand; and they were desirous, therefore, of improving the
neighbourhood. There was very little patriotism, and a large amount
of self-interest, in a suggestion that materially enhanced their own
estates; and it was extremely easy to find an omen that would put
twenty or thirty per cent. upon the value of their property. In pursuance
of the "omen," they liberally gave bricks that did not belong to
them, and followed up their munificence by allowing stone to be cut
from the public quarries, in order that the works might be hastened;
while, as a further act of generosity, it was permitted to the citizens to
pull to pieces their houses at Veii, for the purpose of embellishing
Rome and its vicinity. Speed being the order of the day, every other
kind of order was neglected. All idea of a general plan fell to
the ground, in consequence of every one having a ground plan of
his own. The houses, instead of wearing the aspect of uniformity,
showed a variety of faces, and told each a different story; while
the streets were so constructed, with reference to the sewers, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the latter were as useless as if they had been devised by a modern
commission.</p>

<p>Rome was still exposed to aggression on various sides from numerous
foes; but Camillus, in his capacity of Dictator, first vanquished them,
and then, admitting them to the franchise, received them in the light
of friends, as if, like old carpets, a thorough beating brought them out
in new colours. Whatever may be the fortune of war, it is its misfortune
invariably to entail a heavy debt; and it is a truth of universal application,
that a country, like an individual, no sooner gets into hot water,
than liquidation becomes extremely difficult. Such was the case with
Rome, where taxation became so high, that the poor were compelled to
borrow of the rich, who, with the usual short-sightedness of avarice,
added an exorbitant claim for interest to the principal debt, and thus,
by insisting on both, got in most cases neither.</p>

<p>Manlius, whose quick apprehension of a goose's cackle had rendered
him the deliverer of his country, was exceedingly hurt at the neglect
with which he had been treated, though he had little cause of complaint;
for his merit, after all, consisted chiefly in the fact of his living within
hearing of the fowl-house. He was, however, jealous of the honours
conferred on others; for he expected, no doubt, that the whole of the
plumage of the sacred geese would have been feathers in his cap in the
eyes of his countrymen. Seeking, therefore, another mode of gaining
popularity, he cast his eye upon some unfortunate birds of a different
description&mdash;the unhappy plebeians, who were being plucked like so
many pigeons in the hands of their patrician creditors. He went about
with purses in his hand, like the philanthropist of the old school of
comedy, releasing prisoners for debt; and declaring his determination
to extend his bounty to all who needed it. This advertisement of his
intention brought crowds of applicants to his house; for there was always
"a case of real distress" at hand, for the indulgence of one whose greatest
luxury was the liquidation of other people's liabilities. The popularity
of Manlius excited the jealousy of the patricians, who, not appreciating
his magnanimity, thought him little better than a goose that was always
laying golden eggs, and he retaliated upon them by declaring he had
rather be a fool than a knave; that the money he disposed of was his
own, but that they had grown rich upon gold embezzled from the price
of the city's ransom. Their only answer to the charge was to get him
thrown into prison for making it. The plebeians, finding their friend
and banker in gaol, with nobody to pay their debts, were dissolved in
tears&mdash;the only solvency of which they were capable. Some went into
mourning, while those who could not afford it put on black looks, and
threatened to release him from custody.</p>

<p>The Senate, unable to maintain any charge, and tired, perhaps, of
the expense of keeping him in prison, sent him forth to maintain
himself at his own charge; but his means having been greatly reduced,
he found a corresponding reduction in his popularity. While his
resources flowed in a golden stream, he was a rich pump that any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
was ready to make a handle of; but no sooner did the supply fall off,
and the pump cease to act, than he was left destitute of the commonest
succour. He was eventually brought to trial; and being called upon
for his defence, he produced four hundred insolvents whose debts he
had paid&mdash;and who passed through the Court of Justice&mdash;as witnesses
to his liberality. He then showed his wounds, which were not the sore
places of which the patricians complained; and he ultimately pointed to
the Capitol, in the preservation of which he had acquitted himself so
well, that on the recollection of it, his acquittal was pronounced by the
citizens. His persecutors, however, obtained a new trial, upon which
he was condemned to death; and a slave having been sent with the
despatch containing the news, proceeded to the despatch of Manlius
himself in a treacherous manner. Proposing a walk along the cliff,
under the pretence of friendship, the slave gradually got Manlius near
the edge, until the latter suddenly found himself driven to the last
extremity. Upon this he received a push which sent him down the
Tarpeian Rock; and the man who pretended to have come as a friend,
had been base enough to throw him over. The sudden idea of the
traitor was afterwards carried into frequent execution; for the practice
he had commenced, was subsequently applied to the execution of
criminals.</p>

<p>After the death of Manlius, his house was levelled with the ground,
and he himself experienced the fate of most men when thoroughly
down, for he was repudiated even by his own family. The gens, or
gents, of the Manlii, with a contemptible want of manliness, resolved
that none of the members should ever bear the name of Marcus, which
they avoided as a mark of disgrace, though at one time it had been a
title of honour.</p>

<p>Rome seemed now to be declining, and going down all its seven hills
at once; pestilence killed some, and gave the vapours to others, and
the sewers no longer fulfilled their office, but overflowing, in consequence
of the irregular rebuilding of the city, they threw a damp
upon the inhabitants. The free population was growing daily less,
while the number of patricians continued the same, and there seemed
reason to fear that Rome would soon become one of those most
inconvenient of oligarchies, in which there are many to govern and
comparatively few to be governed. The "eternal city" was in danger
of being prematurely cut off by an early decline, for its constitution was
not yet matured; and though it had once been saved by mere quackery,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
it was now to be preserved by a bolder and wiser regimen.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br />CHAPTER THE TENTH.</h2>

<h3>FROM THE TRIBUNESHIP OF C. LICINIUS TO THE DEFEAT OF THE<br />
GAULS BY VALERIUS.<br /><br /></h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 96px;">

<span class="caption">Roman Soldier.</span>
</div>
<p><span style="margin-left: -1em;" class="smcap">ome</span> was now overwhelmed with debt, and
fresh taxes were imposed to rebuild the
wall of stone; but it would have been as
easy to have got blood out of the stones
themselves, as money from the pockets of
the people. The more they went on not
paying, the more were they called upon to
pay; and ruin appeared inevitable, until
it occurred to the great financial reformers
of the day that there can be no permanent
balance to the credit of a state without a
due adjustment of the balance of power.
Happily for the interests of humanity, there
is scarcely ever a crisis requiring a hero,
but there is a hero for the crisis,&mdash;no situation
demanding a man, without a man
for the situation; and though there may be
on hand a formidable list of those who perpetually
"Want places," we have the consolation
of feeling that when there is a
vacant place to be filled up, there is no
lack of the material required to fill it.</p>

<p>The man for the situation in which Rome then happened to be, was
a certain C. Licinius, who had married the younger daughter of the
patrician, M. Fabius. The lady was considered to have wed below her
station, and the Roman noses of her relatives were converted into
snubs, by the habit of turning up for the purpose of snubbing her.
Being on a visit with her sister, who was the wife of Servius Sulpicius,
the Consular Tribune, she was one day alarmed by such a knocking at
the door as she had never yet heard, and on inquiring the cause, she
found that the lictors of old, like the modern footmen, were in the
habit of estimating, by the number of raps he was worth, the dignity of
their master. The elder Fabia, perceiving her sister's surprise, took
the opportunity of administering a rap on the knuckles, through the
medium of the knocker, and observed, that if the latter had not
married a low plebeian, she would have been accustomed to hearing
her own husband knock as loud, instead of being obliged to knock under.</p>

<p>The vanity of Fabia had received a blow which had deprived her of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
sense; and the effect of the knocking at the door had been so stunning,
that she could scarcely call her head her own. She was resolved that
her husband should make as much noise in the world as her brother-in-law,&mdash;that
he should gain an important post, and win the privilege of
knocking as violently as he chose at his own threshold.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_p0098.png" width="500" height="392" alt="Miss Fabia, the Younger, astonished at the Patrician&#39;s double-knock." title="" />
<span class="caption">Miss Fabia, the Younger, astonished at the Patrician&#39;s double-knock.</span>
<br /><br /></div>

<p>Those who would supply a higher motive to the ambition of C. Licinius,
have asserted that his wife must have been accustomed to the loud
knockings at the house of her father, who had once been consul; but
whether the young lady heard them, unless she remained at home to
answer the door, may be an open question. Whatever may have been
the spur used to stir up ambition in his breast, we, at all events, know
the fact, that C. Licinius was elected a tribune of the people, in conjunction
with his friend Lucius Sextius; so that even if the former
were roused by the knocker, it is not likely that ambition was hammered
into the latter by the same ignoble instrument.</p>

<p>Having obtained their places, they began to bid very high for popularity;
but, like many other bold bidders in the same market, it was by
no means at their own expense that they proposed to make their purchases.
They introduced three new laws: the first, touching other
people's money; the second, touching other people's land; and, in
reference to both these matters, touching and taking were nearly
synonymous.</p>

<p>The first of these laws related to the debts of the plebs, and furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
an easy mode of payment, by providing that all the money
paid as interest should be considered as principal. By this arrangement,
if Spurius owed his tailor one hundred asses, and paid him five
per cent., by way of interest, the tailor would, in thirty years, not only
have had his debt cancelled, without receiving his money, but he would
have to refund no less than fifty asses to Spurius.</p>

<p>This law was sure to obtain for its framers a certain kind of popularity;
for as those who do not meet their engagements are always a
numerous class, it is a safe clap-trap to legislate in favour of the insolvent
classes of the community. C. Licinius became at once the idol
of all those who were continually running into debt one day, and out
of the way the next, and whose valour far outstripped the discretion of
those who had trusted them.</p>

<p>The second law related to land, enacting that no one should occupy
more than five hundred jugera, or acres, and that if he had a surplus, he
should be deprived of it, for the benefit of those who wished to settle
their own liabilities with other people's property. From this arrangement
there was no appeal, for the land was taken away; and if the
owner wished to complain, he had no ground for it.</p>

<p>The third law provided for the restoration of the Consuls, and stipulated
that one should always be a plebeian; but the patricians, who
wanted everything their own way, just as the plebeians wanted everything
theirs, succeeded in putting a veto upon the propositions.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the people, placed between two parties&mdash;one of
which was seeking popularity at any price, while the other was endeavouring
to preserve its exclusive interests at any cost&mdash;were for eight
years deprived of all benefit from either side; and though the public
would have accepted a compromise, Licinius, who knew that when the
point was settled his popularity would be on the wane, declared that
they should either have all or nothing. This policy, which is the same
as that of prohibiting a starving man from accepting a moderate meal,
unless he is invited to a banquet, was well adapted to the purposes of
those whose happiness depends upon the dissatisfaction of all around,
and to whom the success of all their avowed designs is the consummation
of failure.</p>

<p>As long as the bills continued to be thrown out year after year,
C. Licinius and Sextius were pretty sure of their annual election to the
tribuneship. At about the end of the fifth year, the opposition began
to wane, and it became exceedingly likely that the three bills would
pass, when Licinius kept the popularity market brisk, by proposing a
fourth measure, which was sure to be strenuously objected to. This
was a proposal to put on eight new hands to the keeping of the Sibylline
books, by increasing from two to ten the number of the librarians. As
the books were but three, there would, of course, be no less than three
book-keepers and a fraction to each volume,&mdash;an arrangement as objectionable
as pluralism, though in an opposite direction; for it is scarcely
worse to give ten offices to one man, than to put ten men into one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
office. Excuses were, however, found for the suggestion, on the ground
that as five of the book-keepers were to be plebeians, the skill they
would acquire in the interpretation of auguries would qualify a larger
number for the consulship; the patricians having maintained that at
least a smattering of the fortune-telling art was required for the due
execution of the office.</p>

<p>Rome was now suffering from domestic wounds, when, fortunately, a
little counter-irritation was got up, by an attack of the Veliternians on
Tusculum. There is no better cure for a family quarrel, than the
sudden incursion of a neighbour; and when relatives are breaking each
other's heads at Number One, a stone thrown from the garden of
Number Two will frequently, by the establishment of a single new wound,
be the cause of healing half a-dozen. The threatened aggression from
without had caused the ten Tribunes to agree to the measures of their
colleagues, Licinius and Sextius; but the patricians still held out, and
appointed the veteran Furius Camillus to the dictatorship. The
tribes were in the act of voting, when Furius ordered them away, with
violent menaces; but the fury of Furius was impotent from age, and
the Tribunes coolly threatened him with a fine of five hundred thousand
asses. They had come to the correct conclusion that he could not get
together so many asses without selling himself up; he thought it better
to abdicate, and P. Manlius was chosen to stop the fermentation that
the sour old man had created.</p>

<p>The bills were now all passed; and L. Sextius had been appointed
plebeian consul, when the patricians, refusing to sanction what they
could not prevent, declined to ratify the election. As the avalanche
does not wait for the consent of the object it is about to sweep away, so
the will of the public overcame the feeble opposition of the patricians.
The latter, however, succeeded in taking a large portion of power from
the consuls, and giving it to a new magistrate, called a Prætor, who was
invested with authority that some historians have described as almost
preternatural. He was chosen from the patricians, and was, in fact, a
sort of third consul, whose duty it was <i>Jus in urbe dicere</i>,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> to lay down
the law&mdash;a privilege that, if improperly exercised, might include the
prostration of justice&mdash;in the city. The patricians thus kept to themselves
the power of interpreting the law; and as ambiguity seems
inherent in the very nature of law, almost any latitude was left to those
who were at liberty to declare its meaning. The power of the patricians
was further augmented by the appointment of two curule or aristocratic
Ædiles, in addition to the two chosen from the plebeians; and though
their duties related chiefly to the mending of the roads, they had
opportunities of paving the way for many encroachments on the part of
their own order.</p>

<p>The struggle between the patrician and the plebeian parties was
severe, and each endeavoured to represent itself as the only real friend
of the people. Among other acts, in the interest of the masses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
was a measure introduced by C. Poetelius, consisting of a <i>lex de ambitû</i>,
an election law, relating to the getting round, or circumventing, of the
electors by the candidates. It will astonish those acquainted with
election practices to be told, that the word "candidate" is derived from
<i>candidus</i>, in allusion to the white robe usually worn as an emblem of
purity by the seeker of popular suffrages. The white robe, however,
was notoriously, in many cases, a white lie, and the law <i>de ambitû</i> was
passed to prohibit canvassing on market-days, when many more things
were purchased than the articles ostensibly sold; and the butcher has
been known to include in the price of a calf's head, the value he placed
upon his own judgment.</p>

<p>The cause of reform made slow but inevitable progress, though
it was occasionally discredited by some of those incidents which still
cause us to look well to our pockets in the presence of the professional
lover of liberty. C. Licinius, the framer of the law against
occupying more than a certain quantity of the public land, was, it is
said, the first to pay the fine, for holding a double allowance, comprising
five hundred jugera in his own name, and five hundred in that
of his son; a piece of duplicity which was detected and duly punished.
Other instances of private peculation were discovered among those
most clamorous for the public good; and it became necessary in those
days, as in our own, to look among the loudest talkers for the smallest
doers, and the greatest doos of the community.</p>

<p>The law of debt had been rendered somewhat less severe; but the
impossibility of permanently helping those who could not help themselves
was strikingly exemplified. The rate of interest had been
reduced; and advances were to be made by the State to those who
could give security; but those who could give none were to have no
assistance whatever. To those who could pay no interest at all, it
mattered little whether the interest was moderate or high; and an
extension of time for discharging a debt, in the case of a man who
could pay nothing, was only like lengthening the rope with which he
was to hang himself.</p>

<p>In the year of the City 390, a plague broke out in Rome, and the
calamity, which swallowed up thousands, being ascribed to the gods,
repasts were prepared for them, under the title of <i>lectisternia</i>, in order
to draw off their appetites from the people. The richest luxuries were
laid out upon tables, to which the gods were invited; but these tables
caused no diminution in the tables of mortality. As the guests did
not accept in person the invitations addressed to them, they were
represented by images; but this imaginary attendance at a real feast
fed nothing but the superstition of the people. A statue of Jupiter
was laid, at full length, upon a couch of ivory, covered with the softest
cushions; but it was found impossible to produce the sort of impression
that was so earnestly desired. Chairs were also set round for the
goddesses, but none came forward to take the chair at this unfortunate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
banquet. An effort was then made to divert the attention of the gods,
by getting up stage plays, or histriones:<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> but the gods did not patronise
the drama in those days, more than in our own; and whether the
Olympian dinner-hour interfered, or whether no interest was felt in an
entertainment translated from Etruria, as the English drama is from
France, the result was the same in both cases, for the plays, during
their short-lived career, were dead failures. To add to the misery
of the whole affair, while the stage performances were unattended,
there was an inconvenient "succession of overflows" of the Tiber's
banks, which damped the spirits and deluged the houses of the
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Seizing hold of every piece of superstition, instead of taking the
pestilence fairly in hand, the Romans, hearing that a plague had once
been stopped by knocking a nail into the wall of a temple, resolved on
going on that absurd tack; and, for this purpose, a hammer was put
by the ninny-hammers into the hands of Manlius. As the pestilence
had by this time begun to wear itself out, the people were foolish
enough to suppose that the plague had been driven in with the nail;
and Manlius having fulfilled the task, which any carpenter might have
performed, resigned the dictatorship.</p>

<p>It is always the fate of a real or supposed benefactor of the public to
have plenty of private foes; and, indeed, an elevated position is usually
an inviting mark for the arrows of malevolence. Manlius became a
target forthwith; and, had the very bull's eye been aimed at, the apple
of his eye could not have been more effectually hit, than by a wound
sought to be inflicted on him, through his son Titus. The youth had,
it seems, an unfortunate hesitation in his speech, which irritated his
hasty parent; and as the boy could scarcely stammer out a word, a few
words with his father became a very frequent consequence. As he
laboured so much in his speech, the unhappy lad was sent to labour
with his hands among the slaves; and Pomponius, the plebeian
tribune, having a spite against the father, began to regard the son with
the most enlarged benevolence.</p>

<p>Pomponius, by way of prosecuting his vindictive plans, resolved on
prosecuting Manlius, for cruelty to his son; but the boy, in a powerful
fit of filial piety, though he had a considerable hesitation in his own
delivery, had no hesitation whatever about the delivery of his father
from the hands of his enemies. Proceeding to the house of Pomponius,
under the cloak of friendship, and with a dagger under his cloak, he
desired to speak with the Tribune, who was still in bed, and not being
up to the designs of Titus, ordered his admission to the chamber.
The young man had been received in a spirit of friendly confidence by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Pomponius, who only discovered that young Manlius was at daggers-drawn,
when he was seen to brandish a glittering weapon. He
demanded an unconditional withdrawal of the charge against his father;
when the terrified Tribune, finding it impossible to bolster up his
courage, muttered a promise to stay all proceedings; and Titus, who
had formerly irritated his father by stammering, was received with open
arms, for having spoken out so boldly in his favour.<br /><br /></p>

<p>No sooner were the divisions of the people healed, than the city
itself began to be torn to pieces in a most extraordinary manner.
Rome was convulsed to its centre: the earth began to quake, and the
citizens to tremble. A tremendous chasm appeared at length in the
Forum; and as the abyss yawned more and more, it was thought unsafe
for the people to go to sleep over it. Some thought it was a freak of
Nature, who, as if in enjoyment of the cruel sport she occasioned, had
gone into convulsions, and split her sides. Others formed different
conjectures; but the chasm still remained,&mdash;a formidable open question.
Some of the people tried to fill it up with dry rubbish, but they only
filled up their own time, without producing the least effect upon the
cavity. In vain did the largest contractors undertake the job, for it was
impossible to contract the aperture, that, instead of being small by
degrees and beautifully less, grew every day large by fits and starts,
and horribly greater.</p>

<p>At length the augurs were consulted, who, taking a view of the hole,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
announced their conviction that the perforation of the earth would
continue, and that, in fact, it would become in time a frightful bore, if the
most precious thing in Rome were not speedily thrown into it. Upon
this, a young guardsman, named Marcus Curtius, fancying there could be
nothing more precious than his precious self, arrayed himself in a full
suit of armour, and went forth, fully determined to show his metal.
Notice was given that at an appointed time a rapid act of horsemanship
would be performed by M. Curtius; and as there is always great attraction
in a feat which puts life in jeopardy, the attendance, at a performance
where death for the man and the courser was a matter of course,
was what we should call numerous and respectable. All the rank and
fashion of Rome occupied the front seats, at a spectacle throwing every
thing else into the shade, and the performer himself into the very centre
of the earth, which was to prove to him a centre of so much gravity.
Having cantered once or twice round the ring, he prepared for the bold
plunge; but his horse having looked before he leaped, began to plunge
in a different direction. Taking another circuit, M. Curtius, spurred
on by ambition, put his spurs into the animal's side, and the poor brute
was hurried into the abyss, though, had there been any way of backing
out, he would have eagerly jumped at it. The equestrian performance
was no sooner over, than the theatre of the exploit was immediately
closed, and a lake arose on the spot, as if to mark the scene as one that
might command a continued overflow. The place got the name of the
Lacus Curtius, in honour of the hero, if such he may be called; and
his fate certainly involved the sacrifice of one of the most precious
articles in Rome, for it would have been impossible to find in the whole
city such a precious simpleton.</p>

<p>Rome continued at war with the Gauls, who made frequent inroads;
and on one occasion, during the dictatorship of T. Quinctius Pennus, came
within a short distance from the city. The two armies were divided by
the Anio, when the Gauls, who had a giant in their van, sent him on to
the bridge, with an offer to fight any one of the enemy. The Gaul being
at least twenty stone, was far above the ordinary pitch; but Titus
Manlius, a tight-built light-weight&mdash;the plebeian pet, who had already
proved himself too much for the Tribune, Pomponius&mdash;came forward to
accept the polite offer of the giant. The fight was one of extreme
interest, and both parties came up to the encounter with surly confidence.
The plebeian pet wore a suit of plain bronze; but the
giant was painted in various colours, presenting a formidable picture.
The giant aimed the first blow with his right, but the young one
having got away cleverly, commenced jobbing his opponent with such
effect, that the latter, finding it a bad job, fell heavily. The giant
was unable to continue the contest, and young Manlius, taking the
collar, or torques, from his victim's neck, got the title of Torquatus,
which, from its connection with his neckcloth, descended to his domestic
ties, and became a stock name in his <a name="family" id="family"></a>family.<br /><br /></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The Gauls retreated for a while, but having subsequently joined the
Volscii, they got into the Pontine Marshes, and resolved to go through
thick and thin for the purpose of attacking the Romans. Again a
giant appeared in the Gallic ranks, where, it would seem, a giant was
always to be found,&mdash;an appendage indicating less of the brave than of
the fair in the composition of the Gallic army. Again a young Roman
was ready to meet an opponent twice his size; and Marcus Valerius
declared that if the giant meant fighting, he, Marcus Valerius, was to
be heard of at a place agreed upon. The terms were concluded, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the giant came up, with the appearance of contemplating mischief,
when a crow, settling on the Gaul's helmet, by way of crest, soon
enabled the Roman to crow over his crest-fallen antagonist. The bird,
flapping his wings whenever the giant attempted to hit out, put so many
feathers in his face as to render his position ticklish; and as he could
not see with a bundle of crow-quills in his eye, his look-out became
rather desperate. Valerius, in the mean time, laid about him with such
vigour and effect, that the giant, who was doubly blinded with rage and
feathers, knew not where to have him. The contest soon terminated in
favour of the Roman youth, who took the name of Corvus, or the Crow,
from the cause already mentioned. The Gauls were vanquished, and
Valerius was awarded no less than ten prize oxen; so that he obtained
in solid beef, rather than in empty praise, an acknowledgment of his
services. At his triumph, 4000 Volscians were drawn up on each side
of him in chains; but there is something in the idea of his passing
through this Fetter Lane which is repugnant to our more civilised
notions of <a name="true_glory" id="true_glory"></a>true glory.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br />CHAPTER THE ELEVENTH.</h2>

<h3>FROM THE FIRST WAR AGAINST THE SAMNITES TO THE PASSING OF<br />
THE LAWS OF PUBLILIUS.<br /><br /></h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 166px;">
<img src="images/i_p0107.png" width="166" height="200" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p><span style="margin-left: -0.5em;" class="smcap">he</span> Romans were now about to encounter a truly formidable foe, in the
Samnites,&mdash;a warlike people, who had
been extending their territory, by going
to great lengths, and allowing themselves
extraordinary latitude. Coming
down upon Campania, they overlooked
Capua, or rather they did not overlook
it; for, having an eye to its wealth,
they resolved to do their utmost to
become possessed of it. Under these
circumstances, the Campanians, being
unable to find the means of a successful
campaign, applied to Rome for
assistance.</p>

<p>Two consular armies were equipped; one under M. Valerius Corvus,
or the Crow, who was really ravenous for glory, and the other under
A. Cornelius Cossus; this A. Cossus being in fact <span class="smcap">THE</span> Cossus already
spoken of.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Corvus was an enormous favourite with the soldiers; less, however,
on the strength of his moral qualities, than on the strength of his arms
and legs; for he was an athlete of remarkable power. He could leap
so high as to be able to jump over the heads of others of his own standing;
and the rapidity of his promotion is therefore not astonishing. He
was no less light with his tongue than with his legs; for he could run
on almost as pleasantly with the former as he could with the latter.
He was, in fact, an agreeable rattle, who could make and take a joke
with equal ease,&mdash;a quality common in more modern times; for those
who profess to make jokes of their own are very much in the habit of
taking those of other people. He loved a glass of wine, and could
drink it without professing his connoisseurship, after the manner of those
learned wine-bibbers of the present day who are addicted to talking so
much unmeaning buzz on the subject of bees-wing. His relish for the
grape allured him to Mount Gaurus, then clad with vines, where he
could take his observations among the raisins, and make in his mind's
eye a sort of <i>catalogue raisonnée</i> of the enemy.</p>

<p>On this spot a battle ensued, which was fought with such fierceness on
the side of the Romans, that the Samnites afterwards declared they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
seen fire in their opponents' eyes; but the Samnites must have been
light-headed themselves, to have made so absurd a statement. Valerius
having been thus far successful, advanced into the Apennines, where,
what are called the mountain fastnesses, are rendered dangerous by
those occasional loosenesses of the earth that give rise to, or cause the
fall of, an avalanche. Though nothing of this sort fell upon him, he
was expecting the descent of the foe, which suddenly appeared on the
topmost heights, and came down with such a run, that the escape of the
Romans seemed impossible. In this difficult dilemma, a subordinate
officer proved to be the safeguard of the whole Roman army; and as the
noble lion, when netted to the profit of a bold hunter, was delivered by a
mouse, so was the noble-hearted Valerius indebted to P. Decius Mus
for the safety of himself and his followers. P. Decius laid, in fact, a
snare for the Samnites, who were caught in this trap of Mus, or military
mouse-trap. He climbed, with a little band, a height so narrow, that
large numbers could not reach it to dislodge him, though it was necessary
to keep an eye upon him; and, while the Mus attracted the cat-like
vigilance of the whole Samnite army, Valerius and his followers were
allowed to steal away unperceived to their own quarters.</p>

<p>When the enemy, tired with watching, had fallen asleep, Mus crept
out, as quietly as his name would imply, and reached his camp in safety.
He received immediately from the Consul an ox, with gilded horns,
through which he might trumpet his fame; and the soldiers presented
him with a <i>corona obsidionalis</i>&mdash;a crown made of blades of grass&mdash;in
commemoration of their having been gallantly rescued from the blades
of the enemy. The materials for a crown of this description were
plucked on the spot, in memory of the pluck shown on the spot by the
gallant recipient. Such a crown conveyed a finer lesson of morality
than anything that the cold brilliance of gold or jewels could suggest;
for the wreath of grass, converted, by the very sunshine in which it
basked, into the dry and lifeless hayband, told, in a few hours, the
perishable nature of glory.</p>

<p>Aided by the man&#339;uvre of the Mus, the success of Valerius
was complete: the Samnites fled in such consternation that they
left behind them 40,000 shields and 170 standards; so that the
Romans must have found the way literally paved with the flags of the
vanquished. A triumph was decreed to both the Consuls, and foreign
nations sent to congratulate the Romans on their success; the Carthaginians
forwarding a crown of gold, twenty-five pounds in weight, the
mere cartage of which from Carthage must have been costly and
difficult. Compliments poured in upon the conquerors from every side;
for good fortune increases the number of addresses to a state, just as
the success of an individual causes a sensible, or rather a senseless,
addition to the contents of his card-basket. Rome was inundated with
calls upon her&mdash;many of which were for assistance from feeble countries,
whose weak states seemed to be threatened with speedy <a name="dissolution" id="dissolution"></a>dissolution.<br /><br /></p>

<p><br /><br /><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
It was about this time (<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 342) that the garrison at Capua broke
out into revolt, arising, it is said, from the fact that Capua was extremely
rich, and the soldiers very poor; that the latter were hopeless debtors,
and forgot what they owed their country in the vast sums they owed to
their creditors. The story goes on to say, that a corps of heavy
insolvents first originated the idea of sacking the city and bagging its
wealth, by placing it among their own baggage. The Consul, C. Martius
Rutilius, was sent to take the command, and he attempted the soothing
system; but the soldiers were goaded with the fetters of debt, and
refused to be smoothed over, or to submit to remain under irons.
Being in want of a leader, they seized on T. Quinctius, an aged veteran,
whose head was so completely bowed down, that he could not do otherwise
than bow when asked if he would lead them as their general. The nod
of palsy was interpreted into the nod of assent, and T. Quinctius was
selected to oppose Corvus, or the Crow, though the only chance for the
veteran was, that in the capacity of a scare-crow he might succeed in
frightening his antagonist. The armies at length met, when the
insurgents, led by a shivering veteran, began to follow their leader, and
to shake with fear, which induced Valerius to offer them terms, and the
quaking Quinctius was the first to recommend his troops to accept an
amnesty. Thus ended an insurrection, of which the motive appears
vague, and the management thoroughly contemptible. The best opinion
of its origin seems to be, that the army abounded in debtors, who were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
afraid to go home, and who preferred the chances of a mutiny to the
certainty of having to meet their creditors. The only concession they
asked was the cancelling of all their debts; a proposition that savours
rather of the swindler than the patriot. It is, however, an almost
universal fact, that the insolvent classes of a community are to be found
in opposition to the constituted authorities; and, indeed, the strength
or weakness of such an opposition is no bad test, after all, of the merits
of an administration; for if the majority of the people are well-to-do,
the inference must be favourable to the government.</p>

<p>Peace was concluded with the Samnites, but Rome was now on the
brink of a war with the Latins, who sent ambassadors, proposing that
the two people should henceforth be considered as one, in order to
establish their unity. The Senate was to be half Latin and half
Roman; but the latter declared they would not recognise this sort of
half and half in any of their measures. The Consul, T. Manlius, when
he heard the terms, went off into a series of clap-traps, in which he
knew he was perfectly safe; for the contingency in which he might have
been called upon to keep his word, was not at all likely to happen.
He exclaimed, that if the Senate should be half Latin, he would enter
the assembly with his drawn sword, and cause vacancies in half the
seats of the house by slaying all the Latin occupants. This species of
paulo-post-future patriotism is equally common and convenient, for it
pledges the professor to do nothing until after the doing of something
else, which, in all probability, may never happen. T. Manlius was not
put to the test, though he certainly proved himself, in some respects,
ready for the Latins, had they come on in earnest; for poor Annius,
their spokesman, having tumbled down stairs from top to bottom, the
consul brutally chuckled over the weak legs of the unhappy legate.
"Ha! ha!" roared Manlius, with savage mirth, "thus will I prostrate
all the Latins;" and he proceeded to kick at the ambassador, who,
being a man of several stone, was completely stunned by his too facile
descent from the upper landing to the basement of the Temple of
<a name="Jupiter" id="Jupiter"></a>Jupiter.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Metius aggravating Titus Manlius.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />The two Consuls went forth to fight, and both commenced their
campaign by going to sleep, which led naturally to the inquiry, what
they could both have been dreaming about. So thoroughly sympathetic
were they in their drowsiness, that they had dreamed precisely the same
dream, in which each had seen a ghost, who had addressed both in the
same spirit. The spectre, who was decidedly on the shady side of
existence, professed through his lantern jaws to throw a light upon
Rome's future destiny. He told the Consuls that the general on one
side was doomed; but, as this was merely dealing with generalities, he
went on to add, that the whole army on one side was to be buried in
the earth; a suggestion neither side would be very anxious to fall in
with. The spectre, who was rather more communicative than spectres
usually are, and who was not so monosyllabic as a fair average ghost,
proceeded to further explanations, in the course of which he remarked,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
that "the general who first devoted himself to the infernal gods, would,
by that act of devotion, consign the whole of the opposing army to"
a most unpleasant neighbourhood. Both agreed that the one whose
army was the first to back out, should be the first to rush into danger.
The hostile armies accordingly began to recede as far as they could, and
the only contest was to ascertain who could be the cleverest and quickest
in walking in one direction, whilst looking in another. It was an
understood thing that nobody was to fight unless first attacked, and the
general aim was to avoid aiming at anything. Foraging parties went out
daily to try and provoke each other to an onslaught, and the prevailing
sentiment on both sides was a hope, that "somebody would only just
do so and so." Titus Manlius, the son of Torquatus, approached the
Latin camp, when Metius, of Tusculum, attempted by all sorts of provoking
signals to induce the raw youth to commence a combat; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
boy for some time combated nothing but his own inclination, which
would have set him on to an onset. At length he became so irritated
that he could restrain himself no longer, but hurling his javelin with all his
might, it stuck in the mane of the horse of Metius. The poor brute,
looking for sympathy to his master, fell back upon him for protection;
but this act of affectionate confidence was fatal to Metius, who, being
brought to the ground, was saddled with the whole weight of the
unfortunate quadruped. Titus, taking advantage of the position of
Metius, stabbed him with his sword, and the latter, feeling himself pierced,
could only set up a piercing cry, by way of retaliation upon his antagonist.
Having stripped off the armour of his victim, young Titus bore it in
triumph to his father, Torquatus Manlius, who proceeded to imitate
Brutus; but, like most imitations, the appearance of T. Manlius in the
part of the "heavy father" was by no means successful.</p>

<p>Collecting the troops by the sound of trumpet, so that the audience
might be sufficiently large, he threw himself into an imposing attitude;
but the imposition was seen through, and the reception he met with was
far from flattering. He next called forward his son, and denouncing
him as an officer who had disobeyed his governor in a double sense&mdash;his
father and his consul&mdash;the lictors were ordered to proceed, by the
execution of the son, to the execution of their duty. Manlius, having
witnessed the ceremony, buried his face in his toga, expecting at least
three rounds of applause; but the performance fell as dead as his
unhappy offspring. On his return to Rome he was universally cut by
the young men, who were peculiarly alive to a penalty that might be
the death of any one of them. The remains of young Manlius were
collected into a dreary pile, and the trophies he had illegally won were
added as the materials for a bonfire. His obsequies were the first of
the same kind among the Romans that we have been able to meet
with, after a truly industrious analysis of every hole in which the
dust of ages might be found, and a careful sifting of the ashes of
antiquity.</p>

<p>The two armies were still standing, when Decius Mus, who was most
anxious to distinguish himself, and was watching intently to discover
which way the cat would jump, observed a backward movement among
his spearmen. His opportunity for glory had now arrived, and the
gallant Mus, rushing recklessly to the scratch, behaved himself less
like a mus than a lion in the conflict. He fell under a perfect shower
of javelins, and lay on the field literally <i>piqué</i> with the pikes of his
enemies. The latter were dismayed, and his own friends animated by
what had taken place; but the rule of contraries must here have prevailed,
for the death of an adverse general should not have disheartened
the Latins, while the sacrifice of their own chief was, if looked at
in a proper light, but poor encouragement for the Romans. They,
however, grew bold; but it was scarcely necessary for them to strike a
blow, as the Latins yielded under the stroke of a panic. They fell in
such numbers, that three parts are said to have perished, and only a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
fourth of the army remained to tell of the little quarter allowed them
by the enemy.</p>

<p>The Latins suffered so severely from the victory of Decius Mus, that
like rats running from a tottering house, their allies, one by one, fell
away from them. Numisius, the Latin commander, did his utmost to
stir up the spirit of the nation; but the spirit was so thoroughly
weakened by cold water, that it was the act of a spoon to endeavour to
agitate so feeble a compound. He succeeded in raising a slight fermentation,
but what little spirit remained, went off by speedy evaporation
in the process of warming up, under the influence of patriotic fire.
A small and disorderly band, which could not act in concert, was brought
into play, but produced no effect, though it was conducted by Numisius
with considerable energy. The Romans succeeded on every side, the
Latin army was broken down, the confederacy broken up, and one town
after another showed a preference for the better part of valour by
surrendering at discretion. The land taken from the conquered was
distributed among the Roman people; but the word "people" has
frequently a very contracted meaning when profits are being shared,
though the term is comprehensive enough to take in a whole nation
when the services of the "people" are required. It is to be feared
the people who went out for the fight were far more numerous than those
who came in for the spoil that had been got by it.</p>

<p>The beaten Latins had the additional mortification of having to pay
their successful assailants; an arrangement as provoking as it would be
to the victim of an assault to be obliged to discharge the amount of
the penalty, in addition to suffering the inconvenience of the outrage.
Thus was Capua compelled to pension 1600 Campanian knights; and
this pension the Capuans had to give to the knights, simply because the
knights had, in a different sense, given it&mdash;severely&mdash;to the Capuans.
It is doubtful whether the Samnites took anything by the general
adjustment&mdash;if that can be called an adjustment in which justice had
little share; but that they left much behind them is quite notorious.</p>

<p>Among their equipments for battle had been several gorgeous gold
and silver-mounted shields, in the shape of a boy's kite, and as the
Samnites ultimately protected themselves by flying, the kite-like form
of their shields was thoroughly appropriate. Their breasts were covered
with sponge, which gave them a soft-hearted air; and the sinking of
their bosoms under nearly every blow, was clearly perceptible. They
wore a shirt of mail, composed of brazen scales, and the display of so
much metal in their shirts enabled them to present at times a bold
front to the enemy. They had greaves upon their legs, which were a
grievous impediment to their running away; and their helmets, adorned
with lofty plumes, only served to render more conspicuous in defeat
their crest-fallen condition. They wore tunics or coats of cotton next
their skin, and put on their shirts outside; but between these, was a
short garment of wool: so that the only idea we can give of the mode of
making a Samnite <i>toilette</i> is by asking the reader to begin by putting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
on his coat; to place over that his flannel waistcoat, and to add his
shirt by way of finish.</p>

<p>Among the other spoils of the war with the Latins, were the ships
taken from the port of Antium; but the Romans, who were not a
nautical people, had so little idea of the value of a fleet, that they
carried the beaks or prows of the vessels to Rome, and fixed them in
the Forum, as pulpits for their orators.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> How the ships could have
kept above water when subjected to mutilation, it is difficult to conceive;
and indeed it would appear probable that having been deprived of their
heads, they must have gone down, as a matter of stern necessity. We
must, however, do the Roman people the justice to add, that two officers
had been appointed to the superintendence of naval affairs; and some
will declare they see in the mere existence of an Admiralty Board sufficient
to account for much extravagance, and all sorts of blundering. Rome
had hitherto been in the condition of a house divided against itself, or
rather of the adjoining houses pulling against each other, and every
widening of the breach must of course have been attended with danger
to both of them. The cessation of war with the Latins enabled Rome
to draw closer the neighbouring social fabric, and many of its inhabitants
were invited to join, and make themselves part of the family of the Romans.
The latter also began to see the impolicy of keeping up certain distinctions
between class and class, which have the same effect upon a nation, as
the bitter feuds between separate floors are likely to produce upon the
happiness and comfort of a lodging-house. When an upstart one-pair-front
sneers at its own back, or looks down upon an abased basement;
when a crushed and crouching kitchen, waiting in vain for its turn at
the only copper, revenges itself by cutting the only clothes-line&mdash;if the
line is drawn only for the good of those in a higher station, instead of its
being a line drawn, as every line should be, for the good of all;&mdash;when a
household is in such a state, we may see in it the type of a badly ordered
community. Such had been long the unhappy lot of Rome, until it
began to strike on the minds of a few influential men, that no nation
can be really great while the mass of its people are in a state of abject
littleness. The majority of the patricians fortunately took an equally
sensible view of their case, and arrived at the wise conclusion, that
moderate privileges fairly held, and freely conceded, are preferable to
any amount of exclusive advantage, improperly assumed on the one
hand, and impatiently submitted to on the other. Happily for the
patricians, they had among them a man bold enough to incorporate in a
law the opinions of the main part of his own order, and strong enough
to prevail over the weakness and prejudice of the meaner members of
the body.</p>

<p>The name of this patrician reformer was Q. Publilius Philo, who
introduced three laws calculated to extend the basis of political power.
By the first, the <i>curiæ</i>, consisting of patricians only, were compelled to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
confirm the laws passed by the centuries in which the two orders were
mixed; by the second, the <i>plebiscita</i>, or decrees of the plebs, were to
be binding on all Roman citizens; and the third provided, that there
should always be one plebeian censor. These laws, though, perhaps,
well adapted to the wants of the age, were not exactly such as we
should hail with enthusiasm if they were to be brought forward in our
own day by the head of a government. Depriving the curiæ of a veto
was a measure equivalent to a proposition that the measures of the
House of Commons should not require the concurrence of the House of
Lords; and giving the force of law to a <i>plebiscitum</i> was much the same
thing as determining that every resolution of every public meeting
should at once be embodied in the statute-book. Such an arrangement
in the present day would render our laws a curiosity of legislative mosaic
work, laid down without the advantage of uniformity or design. If the
interpretation of an act of Parliament is sometimes difficult, we may
conceive the utter hopelessness of the effort to understand the laws, if
they were to consist of a body of resolutions pouring in constantly
from Exeter Hall, or Freemasons' Tavern, and, occasionally, from a
lamp-post in Trafalgar Square, or a cart on Kennington Common.</p>

<p>With every due respect for the <i>plebiscita</i>&mdash;or resolutions of public
meetings&mdash;we doubt whether any party would be desirous of accepting
them as a substitute for our present method of law-making. The only
chance of safety would be in the fact, that the <i>plebiscitum</i> of to-morrow
would be sure to repeal the <i>plebiscitum</i> of to-day, and the best security
for the state would consist in keeping a public meeting always
assembled to negative every new proposition.</p>

<p>It was many years, however, before Rome, though it had suffered so
much from patrician insolence, was prepared to go to the length of allowing
a <i>plebiscitum</i> the force of law without being subject to the veto of the
senate.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Aristocratic pretension had, however, been carried to such
an extent in Rome, that we could hardly be surprised at any amount of
democratic license; for extremes are sure to meet, and it is unfortunate,
indeed, for a country that is reduced to such extremities.</p>

<h2><br /><br />CHAPTER THE TWELFTH.</h2>

<h3>FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND TO THE END OF THE THIRD<br />
SAMNITE WAR.<br /><br /></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Rome</span> had entered into an alliance with the Samnites; but the
latter became rather suspicious, when they found the former making
friends with all their enemies. Every one who aimed a blow at
Samnium was forthwith taken into the favour of Rome; and as Samnium
was being attacked on every side, the new connexions of Rome became
very numerous. Alexander of Epirus, who had come over as a friend
to the Tarentines, thought he might vary the object of his visit by
becoming the foe to somebody else; and he accordingly pitched upon the
Samnites, who might fairly have traced the Roman hand in some of the
hostile demonstrations that were made against them. There being
some inconvenience in fighting through a third party, to say nothing of
the unsatisfactory nature of such an arrangement to the go-between,
the Romans and the Samnites soon came into direct collision.</p>

<p>One of the Consuls, D. J. Brutus, was sent with troops to Apulia;
but the other Consul, L. Furius Camillus, was in such wretched health,
that he could scarcely hold up his own head, and was quite unfit for the
head of an army. L. Papirius Cursor, the dictator, undertook the
command himself; but on his way to Samnium he was suddenly
recalled to Rome, in consequence of some blunder with the auspices.
Leaving behind him Q. Fabius, his master of the horse, he desired that
officer to do nothing; for L. P. Cursor having taken a cursory view of
the state of affairs, saw there was a victory to be gained, and wished to
reserve to himself the glory of gaining it. Q. Fabius, with a natural
reluctance to be shelved, determined to do the work himself; and by
the time his chief returned, had won a brilliant victory. The rage
of the principal knew no bounds, when he discovered that everything
had been accomplished in his absence; for though there might have
been no objection to the subordinate's actually doing all that was to be
done, there was an unpardonable violation of official etiquette in its
having been got through when the chief was away, and when it was,
therefore, notorious that he could have had no hand in it. The
dictator was so indignant, that he would have visited his deputy with
all the severity of military law, for having dared to show a capacity to
command, when his capacity was, in fact, subordinate. It was looked
upon by official men as an act likely to spoil the official market, by
showing that the most highly-paid services are not always the best;
and it was felt, also, that the chief had been ousted of his prescriptive
title to claim, as his own perquisites, all the tact and talent of his
underling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
L. P. Cursor swore vengeance upon the head of Q. Fabius; but the
soldiers threatened a revolt in the event of his being punished, and
the hero who had put a whole army to flight was obliged to take to his
heels for having dared to use his head in the absence of his superior.</p>

<p>The Dictator had rendered himself very unpopular with the troops
by his injustice and cruelty to Q. Fabius; but he regained his popularity
by allowing them to be guilty of all sorts of injustice and cruelty
towards a vanquished enemy. Though their indignation had been
raised against him, through the medium of their generous sympathies,
he now appealed to their meanest passions, by promising them the
fullest license in plundering the foe; and such is the inconsistency of
human nature, that he did not appeal in vain; for, urged by avarice,
they fought with such determination as to secure a victory. Pillage
became at once the order of the day, and a truce was granted for one
year, on condition that the Samnites, who had been robbed of everything
available at the moment, should become responsible for a twelvemonth's
pay to the Dictator's army.</p>

<p>The period of the truce was occupied in negotiation; for it would
have been rather too gross a piece of effrontery on the part of the
Romans to continue attacking the very party from whom they were
receiving their pay: and having waited till the receipt of the last
instalment, they announced that the only terms they would accept
would be the unconditional assent of the Samnites to anything that
might be proposed to them.</p>

<p>This result was so excessively disgusting to the Samnites, that some
actually cried with rage, while others cried for vengeance. A few of
the most influential, with tears in their eyes, went to their fellow-countrymen
literally with a cry; but amidst all this broken-heartedness,
there was a general raising of the nation's spirit. The Samnites felt
that the time for action had arrived, and C. Pontius was chosen to act
as their general. He at once laid siege to Luceria, when disguising ten
of his soldiers as shepherds, he sent them forth with instructions to look
as sheepish as they could, and they had also full directions how to
act in the event of their being captured. The Romans, commanded
by T. Veturius and Sp. Postumius, soon fell in with the Samnite
masqueraders, whose real character was not suspected; for it does not
appear to have excited any surprise that ten shepherds should be
hanging about a neighbourhood in which no sheep were perceptible.
With a simplicity more suited to romance than history, the Romans
submitted themselves to the guidance of the ten anonymous shepherds,
who conducted the whole army into the Caudine forks, as easily as if
the veterans had connived at their own betrayal. No sooner were they
lost among the forks, than the soldiers learned what spoons they had
been, for they found themselves blocked in by the enemy. They fought
with considerable bravery, but the Samnites, who lined the surrounding
heights, were completely out of their reach, and the Romans, having
made a few vain efforts to throw up their spears, suddenly threw up
the contest. Of every weapon they hurled, the consequence fell upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
their own heads, and nothing was left but to make the best terms they
could with the enemy.</p>

<p>Pontius, the Samnite general, was puzzled how to act, and sent to
inquire of his father what he should do, when the old man replied,
"Release them unhurt!" and the answer not being quite satisfactory,
another messenger was sent, who brought back the brief but expressive
recommendation to "cut them all to pieces." Pontius, thinking the
old gentleman had gone out of his mind, sought a personal explanation;
but the veteran, who was clearly averse to doing anything by halves, or
meeting anybody half-way, persevered in his recommendation to his
son, to do one thing or the other. The Samnites were struck with
admiration at the wisdom of the sage; but although all were dumbfounded
by the profound philosophy of the advice, nobody thought of
taking it. Pontius proposed terms, and having been deceived so frequently
by the Romans before, he magnanimously resolved to try and
be even with them at last, by putting them and his own countrymen on
a perfect equality. He stipulated for the restoration to the Samnites of
all the places taken from them; but the most painful portion of the
arrangement to the Romans was their being called upon to pass under
the yoke,&mdash;a ceremony which was supposed to lower for ever all who
had once stooped to it.</p>

<p>Six hundred equites were held as hostages for the due observance of
the treaty, and these knights were, in fact, so many pawns, held in
pledge for the honour of the Romans. The Consuls, stripped of every
thing but their shirts, and looking the most deplorable objects, crawled
under the yoke, followed by the whole army in the same wretched
undress as their leaders. As they passed through Capua, the inhabitants,
touched with sympathy, came forth with bundles of left-off wearing
apparel, which was tendered to the humiliated troops; but their wounds
were too deep for ordinary dressing. They walked silently to their
homes, through the back streets of the city. All business was suspended
on the day of their arrival, and though the Romans had seen suffering
in almost every variety of guise, they had never met with it under such
melancholy Guys as those that were then before them. The Consuls
resigned their offices as rapidly as they could, for their nominal dignity
only added to their real disgrace, and they may be supposed to have felt
the relief experienced by the broken-spirited cur, whose tail has just
undergone the curtailment of the hateful, but glittering <a name="kettle" id="kettle"></a>kettle.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 409px;">

<span class="caption">The Romans clothed by the Inhabitants of Capua.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />Rome, smarting under the disgrace of a defeat, brought on by want
of resolution in the troops, proceeded to incur a still greater disgrace by
a resolution of the Senate. That body having met to consider the
agreement entered into with the Samnites, determined not to ratify it;
and, though aware of the fact, that six hundred Roman knights were
detained as hostages, in chains, the Senate cared as little for their bonds
as for the words of the Consuls, which had been passed for the fulfilment
of the treaty. Spurius Postumius, who had nothing genuine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in his conduct, was among the first to propose the violation of the
arrangement he had made, and recommended that he himself, as well
as all who had agreed to peace, should be, for the look of the thing,
surrendered to the Samnites. He entered so fully into the deception
about to be enacted, that when the Lictor was tying the cord loosely, as
if conscious of the illusory character of the whole proceeding, Spurius
insisted upon the cords being drawn sufficiently tight to enable him to
declare to the Samnites that his hands were really tied, and that, if
the Senate refused to be bound by his arrangements, he was so
thoroughly bound by theirs as to be utterly powerless. Carrying the
farce still further, he was no sooner delivered up to the Samnites than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
he turned round upon the Roman Fecial, and exclaiming, "I am now
a Samnite," administered to the proper officer a violent kick, as if to
show that he and Rome were to be henceforth on a hostile footing.
The Samnite general looked on with contempt at the whole affair;
the hostages were refused, and the 600 knights were also sent back; for
Pontius had expected the Romans to keep their word, and was neither
ready nor willing to be burdened with the keep of several hundred
captives. This remarkable breach of their own faith left a more
permanent mark upon them than any breach that could have been made
by an enemy in the walls of their city; and the fact of their having
built a temple to Public Credit, rendered their discreditable conduct
still more remarkable.</p>

<p>The Samnites and the Romans were now perfectly agreed in their
determination to fall out, wherever they might happen to fall in with
one another. A series of small conflicts ensued, of which the accounts
are almost as conflicting as the battles themselves; but there is every
reason to believe that Fortune showered her favours right and left, by
giving them first to one side and then to the other. L. Papirius
Cursor, the Roman Consul, seems to have made himself the pre-cursor
of his country's ultimate success, for he is said to have led the way to
it by recovering Luceria. Hostilities had by this time become so fierce,
that it was necessary to take a little breathing time on both sides, and
a truce of two years was agreed upon. The war was then renewed
under L. Æmilius and Q. Fabius, the dictators, who fought with various
results, taking occasionally a city, and at other times being compelled to
take what they were not at all disposed to receive at the hands of an
enemy. No very remarkable incident occurred at the recommencement
of the war, excepting the taking of the town of Sora by treachery; but
meanness and deception were so common in the time we write of, that
any event involving those despicable qualities cannot be considered
unusual. Sora was situated on a rocky eminence, and though secure to
a certain extent in its lofty position, it was not above the reach of that
low cunning which will stoop to anything for the attainment of its object.
A deserter, who appears to have had everything his own way among the
Samnites, as well as among the Romans, persuaded the latter to retire
some miles off, as if they had abandoned the siege, and then ordered
them to have a regiment of cavalry concealed in a wood near the city.
What the Samnites were about during these proceedings does not
appear; nor is it easy to understand how they could have overlooked an
important branch of the forces of the enemy among the trees; but
tradition, when she wishes to shut her eyes to a difficulty, never hesitates
to shut the eyes of all whose vigilance might have been fatal to the
incident about to be related. The inhabitants of Sora may therefore
be supposed to have been fast asleep and slow to wake, or to have had
their backs turned, or to have taken something which had turned their
heads, when the deserter was making his arrangements for the betrayal
of their city. Having taken the steps already described, he conducted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
ten Roman soldiers up a sort of back staircase behind the crags; and
the blindness of the inhabitants of Sora had come to such a pass, that
the mountain pass was so thoroughly lost sight of as to be left without
a single sentinel. Having lodged the ten men in the fortress, he
concealed them there until night; but it is difficult to say how the ten
stalwart soldiers could have been so thoroughly put away in the day-time
as not to be observed, unless tradition, wishing to put her own construction
on the affair, has proceeded to the construction of some secret cupboard
in the fortress, where the men may have been closeted together
until the hour arrived for their being brought into action. Waiting
till the dead of night, the deserter desired the ten men to shout
as loud as they possibly could, and to keep on hallooing until the cavalry
were out of the wood; a movement which was to be effected when the
deserter, rushing into the city, had frightened the inhabitants out of it,
by running all over the town in a state of pretended alarm, which was
to be accounted for by the continued shouting of the ten men in the
citadel. Notwithstanding the numerous objections to the veracity of this
story, tradition has handed it down to us, and we, as in duty bound,
continue to hand it on, though we do not allow it to pass through our
fingers without taking the precaution to stamp it with the mark of
counterfeit. Tradition proceeds to say that the scheme was perfectly
successful: that the citizens, frightened by the shouting of the ten
soldiers in the citadel, ran into, or rather on to, the arms of the legions
who were advancing with drawn swords to the gates of the city.</p>

<p>The Samnites having become weary of war, and tired of an existence
which was passed in continually fighting for their lives, determined to
bring matters to an issue as fast as possible. They met the Romans
under Q. Fabius at Lautulæ, where Q was driven into a corner, and ran
away, when his army not receiving from him the cue to fight, rapidly
followed his example. C. Fabius having subsequently come to the
assistance of Q., they united their forces, and being almost two to one
against the Samnites, they obtained a victory.</p>

<p>Rome had, however, quite enough to contend against in various
quarters; and, among others, the Ausonians betrayed hostile feelings,
which were rendered abortive by another betrayal of a very disgraceful
character. Among the Ausonians there existed a nominal nobility,
whose rank gave them a sort of respectability to which they possessed
no moral title. These nobles, by name and ignobles by nature, were
mean enough to admit, by stealth, into some of the cities of Ausonia, a
number of Roman soldiers in disguise, who, with the cruelty so commonly
associated with fraud, commenced a general slaughter of the
inhabitants.</p>

<p>It would be a waste of time and patience, both to writer and reader,
were we to ask him to accompany us into every little field where a little
skirmish may have taken place, at about this period, between Rome and
her enemies. To describe the fluctuations of the fortune of war, would
be as dry and unprofitable as the minute narration of all the incidents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of a long game at heads and tails; nor would the historian have
repeated very often the particulars of the throwing up the coin, before
the reader would be found throwing up the history. We shall, therefore,
content ourselves with giving the heads in a curtailed form,
without going into the particulars of the movements of the generals.
There was an enormous quantity of putting to the sword on both sides,
but without running through the whole, we will submit to the eye of
the reader the points best adapted for the use of the pupil. In the
north of Samnium, the Romans were surprised by an Etruscan army,
and nearly destroyed; but when they were more than half killed, they
began to look alive, and completely exterminated the foe, whose
survivors, consisting of their cattle, fell into the hands of the conquerors.
The Consul, C. Marcius, had succeeded in taking a place
called Allifæ; but the Samnites soon afterwards brought themselves
completely round, and made him the centre of a circle, which, as he was
entirely cut off from Rome, was to him a centre of extreme gravity.
Not even a messenger could find a way to take to the city the tidings
of the Consul's perilous position; but it seems to have become known,
by some means or other, for L. Cursor hastened to the scene, and
caused the Samnites to abandon their position. Beginning to despond,
they sought a truce, for which they had to pay a most exorbitant price,
in cash, corn, and clothes; for they had to pay, feed, and clothe for
three months the troops who had paid them off, in another shape, and
submitted them to a long series of thorough dressings. They, however,
still held out against acknowledging the sovereignty of Rome,
and thought themselves exempt from humiliation in making themselves
the slaves in fact, as long as they remained independent in
name, of that ambitious power. The main point of dispute remaining
still undisposed of, more fighting ensued, until Samnium was at length
so thoroughly reduced as to be obliged to confess itself beaten at last;
and the Samnites, who had by degrees parted with everything they
possessed for the luxury of maintaining that they were free to do as
they pleased with their own, acknowledged Rome to be their master.
Rome also needed relaxation; for her energies had become relaxed by a
war of twenty years; and both parties having done each other all the
harm they could, ceased only because the power of mischief had become
completely lost on one side, and seriously impaired on the other.</p>

<p>So inveterate was the hostility between Samnium and Rome, that
any pause in their actual conflict was filled up by preparations for a
renewal, the first opportunity for which they were eagerly expecting to
take advantage of. The third Samnite war was commenced by an
attempt on the part of the Samnites to recover Lucania, and for that
purpose they stupified the Lucanians by a series of severe beatings,
which deadened the sense of the inhabitants to their danger. The
nobles, who seem to have had the instinct of self-preservation in a higher
degree than the virtue of patriotism, were quite prepared to obey a
master who would purchase, rather than resist an enemy who would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
harass, them. They accordingly offered their allegiance to Rome, on
condition that Rome would save them the trouble of defending themselves
against Samnium. Roman envoys were despatched, in compliance
with this arrangement, to call upon the Samnites to evacuate Lucania;
but the envoys were unceremoniously ordered off, and betook themselves
to a very quick return, unattended by the smallest profit. After a
few minor encounters, the two Consuls, Q. Fabius and P. Decius Mus,
the son of old Mus, already alluded to, led their combined forces
into Samnium, and went different ways, though they fully purposed
pulling together. Q. Fabius met the whole of the Samnite army,
and a battle commenced, in which each was rapidly destroying the
other's soldiers in about equal numbers, without any good to either,
beyond the very melancholy satisfaction of being even with each
other in the losing game that both sides were playing. This would
probably have continued until the chances of war had degenerated into
a game of odd man, in which the sole survivor would have been the
victor, when a Samnite soldier, rather more far-seeing than the rest,
espied what he supposed to be the army of Decius. That there are
some things to which it is better to shut one's eyes, was proved on this
occasion; for the long-sighted Samnite had no sooner espied a body of
men in the back-ground, who were in reality the reserve of Q. Fabius,
than he frightened himself and his fellow soldiers, by spreading a rumour
that Mus was creeping slowly, but surely, up to them. The Samnites
were at once struck with a panic, the blow inflicted by which is always
more fatal than that of the sword, and the loss of spirit led to the
destruction of nearly the whole body. Decius having joined his colleague,
the two Consuls hunted the country of the Samnites, making game of
everything that came in the way, while Appius Claudius carried on the
war in Etruria. We should be curious to see the population returns&mdash;if
any such existed&mdash;in relation to the Samnites, who were, according to
tradition, being continually cut to pieces, routed, ravaged, and otherwise
destroyed; but who, nevertheless, were, according to tradition, continually
taking the field again in large numbers, as if nothing had
happened. L. Valerius had just returned from assisting his colleague,
Appius Claudius, in Etruria, when the Samnites turned up rather
abundantly on the Vulturnus, and being at once attacked, were again
cut to pieces, for by no means the last or only time on the great stage of
history.</p>

<p>At about the same time, when the news of this victory reached Rome
the Gauls were expected, and though it was against the law that the same
Consul should be elected twice in ten years, the Romans, altering the
constitution, without the trouble of revision, suspended the law for the
purpose of securing the services of Q. Fabius.</p>

<p>He was re-elected with his colleague Decius Mus, and before
setting out for battle, they consulted the augurs, who evinced their
usual readiness to interpret the omens in the most favourable manner.
On coming to the fortified camp of Appius Claudius, Fabius found the
soldiers collecting wood, to form a stockade, which drew from him the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
remark, "It is not by cutting sticks you can succeed, but by showing a
bold front to the enemy." The soldiers, animated by his words&mdash;which,
to say the truth, do not appear to have anything particularly invigorating
about them&mdash;were suddenly roused into lions, after having been in a
lamb-like or sheepish condition, and instead of cutting any more wood,
or pulling up the trunks of trees, began to pluck up a proper spirit.
The Romans had now about 90,000 troops in the field, if we adopt the
round numbers handed down to us, which do not always square with
probability; but the historians wisely provide, as far as possible, for any
deficiency that may arise in the course of the various cuttings to pieces,
annihilations, and other contingencies which are at one time or other
the alleged fate of nearly every army. The vast necessity for a surplus
that may be boldly dealt with, can perhaps be understood from a circumstance
recorded with reference to a legion led by L. Scipio. It had
been stationed near Camerinum, and had in an engagement with the
foe been cut to pieces without having been missed; nor was the loss
discovered until their own countrymen recognised their heads carried on
the lances of the advancing enemy. When the fact thus frightfully
stared them in the face, the countenances of the Romans fell with
sympathy at the fate of their comrades, which it must be confessed
presented some very horrid features.</p>

<p>At length the hostile armies met near Sentinum in Umbria&mdash;the
Romans mustering in considerable force, and the Samnites, in spite of
much pruning, which seemed only to have the effect of increasing their
growth, forming a highly respectable remnant. The latter had also a
considerable accession in the shape of Gauls, Umbrians, and Etrurians;
for tradition, when it desires to give interest to a battle, is always
prepared to scrape together from all quarters a sufficient number of
soldiers, on both sides, to equalise the chances of victory. While the
armies were drawn out in line before each other, they are said to have
been suddenly occupied in the contemplation of the following rather
remarkable incident. A deer, pursued by a wolf, ran rapidly down
the middle, and the two animals were on the point of going up again,
when the deer, apparently changing its mind, ran among the Gauls,
who, without hesitation, converted it into venison. The wolf, with a
cunning worthy of the fox, declined venturing on an experiment that
had been so costly to the deer, and turned in among the Romans, who,
perhaps, fearing that the wolf might have a taste for calves as well as
for sheep, took the precaution to save their legs, by making as wide an
opening as possible. No sooner was the wolf out of the way, than the
Romans began to boast that fear had gone to the foe in the shape of a
deer, while valour had come to their side in the person of Mars, whom
they declared they saw hidden under the hide of a wolf, his favourite
animal. The battle at length commenced, and the day being exceedingly
warm, added, in one sense, most inconveniently to the heat
of the contest. The Gauls created immense consternation among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Romans by rushing down upon them in chariots armed with scythes, at
the sight of which they were terribly cut up, and unmercifully cut down,
before they had time to recover from their astonishment. Not wishing
to be left as a wretched harvest on the field, the Romans were about to
fly, when they were once more saved by a Mus, who on this occasion
will be thought by some to have deserved the epithet of "<i>ridiculus</i>."
Recollecting the example of his father, he resolved to sacrifice himself
for the benefit of his country, and, calling upon the pontiff, he caused
his vow to be regularly registered. The ceremony having been
gone through, in due form, he put spurs to his horse, and rushing
in among the foe, he became, as it were, a scabbard for the
swords of all who could get within reach of him. The Gauls were
so completely stupified by what they saw, that they were literally
lost in wonder; for, while they stood staring with astonishment, the
Romans fell upon and massacred nearly the whole of them. Gellius
Egnatius, the Samnite General, was slain, together with many thousands
of his own countrymen, who are described by tradition as having
been once more cut to pieces, though these pieces are not the last
in which they are destined to make their appearance. History,
with a natural anxiety to keep a stock of Samnites on hand for
future use, suggests that 5000 ran away, though the Romans were
too much reduced to run after them, and as the fugitives lost a
thousand of their number by fighting, during their retreat, it must
be presumed that, in their extreme nervousness, they began attacking
each other.</p>

<p>Q. Fabius led back his army into Etruria, which had recently been
thoroughly ravaged by Cn. Fulvius; and the Etruscans, who had already
been beaten once, were thoroughly beaten again, so that any residue of
strength might be effectually knocked out of them. The retreating
Samnites had by this time arrived at the valley of Vulturnus, where the
country was in such a state that they could find nothing to eat; but,
for a people who were accustomed to survive the constant infliction of
the sword, the absence of food was a very subordinate grievance.
Volumnius and Appius Claudius fell upon them with their united forces,
and the Samnites were once more cut to pieces; but, notwithstanding
their fragmentary condition, they were able to appear collected and calm,
before the end of the following year, in Etruria. They, at length,
mustered all their strength, and determined on making a desperate
effort against the Romans, who were in great force under Papirius
Cursor, near Aquilonia. Papirius sent for an augur, who kept a small
brood of sacred chickens, for the purpose of hatching up something to
say to those who consulted him. The augur declared that the omens were
favourable, for the chickens had eaten a hearty meal; but an officer,
who had watched the birds at breakfast, and had been struck by the
extreme delicacy of their appetites, came forward to impute foul play
to the augur. Papirius immediately ordered the soothsayer to be placed
in the front of the line of battle, where the poor old man, who was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
chicken in age, whatever he may have been at heart, was made to
answer with his life for having failed to answer with truth the questions
proposed to him.</p>

<p>The Samnites paid no attention to omens, but bound each other by
awful oaths to undergo their usual fate of being cut to pieces rather
than surrender; and it must be admitted that they bore the penalty
of defeat with a coolness that can only be accounted for by their being
thoroughly used to it. No less than 16,000 took the oath, and kept
it so well that the whole 16,000 were found in bits precisely where they
had taken their places in battle. We might express our doubts upon
this subject, were it not that the sage critics, who are averse to any
departure from the gravity of history, would perhaps accuse us of levity
in refusing credence to Livy, on whose authority the tale is told, though
dulness itself will probably be roused to a stare, if incapable of a smile
at the remarkable dish of hash which the serious historians call upon
him to <a name="swallow" id="swallow"></a>swallow.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Samnite Soldier.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />The victory of Rome was complete, and the Samnites, whose riches
seem to have been almost as inexhaustible as their numbers, yielded up
spoil that might appear fabulous in the eyes of any but those who are
so thoroughly matter-of-fact as to be incapable of distinguishing a
matter of fiction. To swell the triumph of the conquerors, Papirius is
said to have given crowns of gold and silver to officers and men, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
collars and bracelets of the same precious material; from which it
would seem that the Samnites had abandoned their ornaments in
running away; for metal, though current on ordinary occasions, goes a
very little way in the hands of those who are groaning beneath the
weight of it.</p>

<p>Once more the Samnites poured themselves as copiously and mysteriously
as the streams that flow from the inexhaustible bottle of the
conjuror over the greater part of Campania, and Q. Fabius Gurges
took the command of the Roman army. The Samnites were led by
C. Pontius, an aged prodigy, who had seen much service, which had
been of no service whatever to his countrymen, for they had not
even learned to profit by the lessons of experience. C. Pontius
combined, in a remarkable degree, the imbecility of age with the
rashness of youth, and presented the sad spectacle of juvenile and
senile indiscretion combined, or the junction of the characteristics of an
old fool and a young fool in the same individual. Q. Fabius, however,
reckoned too confidently on success; and seeing a detachment of the
Samnites executing a man&#339;uvre, he thought it was the whole body in
the act of retreat, which caused him to proceed so carelessly, that he
was himself defeated, and would have had his army utterly destroyed,
but for the feebleness of his antagonists.</p>

<p>The news of the defeat of Fabius excited much dissatisfaction
at Rome, and the General was about to be recalled, when his father, in
an uncontrollable fit of nepotism, implored the people to allow the
young man to keep his place&mdash;a request that was at length granted.
The impolicy of overlooking the incompetence of the son at the
request of the father, was nearly being exemplified in a fatal manner;
for the younger Fabius was on the point of another failure, and an
alarming sacrifice of all his army, when Fabius Maximus came up with
a reserve, which turned the fortune of the day, by the cutting to pieces
of 20,000 Samnites; while 4000, including poor old Pontius, were
made prisoners. It will be seen that tradition, while dooming 20,000
Samnites to the sword, reserves 4000 in captivity as a surplus to
supply future contingencies. Although the better authorities consider
that in the last-mentioned battle this people, who were almost as
endless as their hostilities were aimless, must have been used up,
there are still a few skirmishes to be met with on the borders, if not
within the verge of truth, which require that a few thousand Samnites
should be kept as a reserve for the purposes of the historian.</p>

<p>C. Pontius was led as a prisoner in the triumph granted to the
Fabii; but this triumph, and everything connected with it, was converted
into a disgrace by the beheading of the poor old Samnite chief,
who, if he had been weak enough to place himself in opposition to
Rome, had, after the battle of the Caudine forks, evinced an amiable
weakness towards the captives that had fallen into his power. Fabius
Maximus having died soon after, tradition, who is much addicted to
returning verdicts in the absence of evidence, declares the cause of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
death to have been a broken heart; and, as it would certainly have
been proper under all the circumstances that he should have done so,
we have no inclination to disturb the rather doubtful decision.</p>

<p>Some authorities,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> finding they have a Samnite surplus to deal
with, describe the Samnites as being again defeated by M. Curius
Dentatus, who seems to have been a curiosity in his way; for, having
been offered a house with seven hundred jugera as his share of booty,
he refused to accept more than seven, which was the portion allotted to
his comrades. Those who are accustomed to read of, and admire, the
system on which prize-money is apportioned in modern times,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> will
probably set down Curius Dentatus as a remarkable fool; and indeed,
though his self-denial smacks of patriotism, we are not sure of its
justice; for, if he had performed his duty as a general, his services to
his country must have been more valuable than those of the ordinary
soldiers under him. It may be, however, that he knew best what he
had done, and what he deserved; nor must we forget the great fact
that in taking a man's own estimate of his own merits, we run very
little danger of underrating them.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br />CHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH.</h2>

<h3>ON THE PEACEFUL OCCUPATIONS OF THE ROMANS. FROM SCARCITY OF<br />
SUBJECT, NECESSARILY A VERY SHORT CHAPTER.<br /><br /></h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 127px;">
<img src="images/i_p0129.png" width="127" height="200" alt="Æsculapius." title="" />
<span class="caption">Æsculapius.</span>
</div>

<p><span style="margin-left:-1em" class="smcap">t</span> is with sincere satisfaction that
we turn from the monotonous
details of war to the arts of peace;
and though it is usually said that
the stain of blood can never be
wiped out, we are glad to find
that the marks and traces of discord
are doubtful and few, while
the evidences of the nobler pursuits
of man are numerous and
genuine. Among the most enduring
monuments of the art
and industry of the Romans, may
still be traced the remains of the
celebrated Via Appia, or Appian
Way, the secret for the formation
of which would be invaluable to
the inhabitants of our large towns,
and particularly to the Paving
Boards of the Metropolis. While
parts of the Via Appia remain
perfect after upwards of twenty
centuries, the streets of London
are torn to pieces year after year; and it might melt a heart of stone&mdash;if
stone possessed a heart&mdash;to see the granite continually disturbed
by the remorseless pickaxe. The Via Appia was constructed of large
blocks placed very closely together; and though modern Paving Boards
have done their best by laying their heads together to imitate the plan,
success has never rewarded their labours.</p>

<p>Not less wonderful than the road of Appius, was the aqueduct that
bore his name, and which had solved the question so apparently
incapable of solution in our own times, of the means of securing a
supply of water to a great Metropolis. Though water was not commonly
drunk by the Romans as it is by ourselves, and though the
Tiber was purity itself compared with the Thames, the liquid was so
clearly or rather so thickly undrinkable, that a supply was brought from
a distance of eight miles, in the manner we have mentioned.</p>

<p>While all admit the grandeur of the aqueducts of ancient Rome,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
objection has been made to their construction as a needless expense;
and it has been said, that their lofty arches proved only the height to
which folly and extravagance could be carried. Pipes have been
suggested as capable of answering every useful purpose; but considering
the difficulty of obtaining them sufficiently large, of keeping them always
free from obstruction, and other obvious disadvantages, it is doubtful
whether the pipe, after payment of the piper, would prove so economical
in the main. The aqueduct, indeed, has been recently adopted on a
large scale, by a people not likely to retrograde in arts and sciences,
though the rapidity with which they go a-head may cause them to run
through the whole circle of ingenuity, till the most modern invention,
arriving at the same point as the most ancient, affords an illustration of
the meeting of extremes. New York now receives its supply of water
through an aqueduct,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> carried on solid masonry, over valleys and rivers,
under hills and tunnels, for a distance of forty miles; a proof that when
a city has the will to obtain pure water, there is always a way&mdash;though
it may be forty miles in length&mdash;for getting what is required.</p>

<p>In Rome, it had been customary to bore a well where water was
wanted, but the water was so impure, that it soon became necessary to
let well alone. The science of engineering, aided by that great moral
engine, their own energy, enabled the inhabitants to bring their supplies
from a considerable distance, and as the aqueducts were gradually sloped,
the water followed, as it were, its own inclination in coming to Rome.
Filtration was ingeniously provided for, at convenient distances, by
reservoirs having two compartments, into one of which the water fell,
and passing into the other before returning to the main body, there was
time for the deposit of all impurities. Every precaution was taken
against the intrusion of those unhappy families of animalculæ, which are
continually tearing each other to pieces in every drop of the London
element, and whose voracity seems to hold out a faint hope that, as they
are continually demolishing each other, they may be all mutually
swallowed, before the supply of the Metropolis with pure water is
achieved.</p>

<p>During the Censorship of Appius Claudius, the cause of literature,
or at least the dignity of the profession of a public writer, was advanced&mdash;though,
perhaps, we ought rather to say, that official employment was
honoured&mdash;by the promotion of Cn. Flavius, a scribe, to the Curule
Ædileship. This individual appears to have possessed the happy gift of
investing dry subjects with the garb of popularity; and he had won
considerable reputation by giving the forms of legal actions in a shape
that rendered them comprehensible to the general reader. He made
law legible in his work on <i>legis actiones</i>, and had assisted the spread
of information by an almanack or calendar, in which the <i>dies fasti</i> and
<i>nefasti</i> were marked down, and other information afforded which could
only have been obtained previously from the pontiffs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>
<p>The lawyers and the priests, who were less liberal in those days
than in our own, were both enraged with an author who had laid
open the mysteries of both professions by a few happy touches of his
pen; and on his being called upon to give the public the benefit
of his services as a curule ædile, they appealed to the miserable
prejudice existing against a man who had shown talent in one line,
when called upon to exert his abilities in some new direction. The
nobility were especially affected at the prospect of the public service
being thrown open to merit alone, instead of gentle or gentile dulness
being allowed the sole use and abuse of official honour and emolument.
Exclusiveness and illiberality could not, even in those days, wholly
prevail, though the opponents of the public writer succeeded in causing
him to abandon not only his literary pursuits, but to give up all his
books, and thus render himself emblematically on a par with themselves
in ignorance, by divesting himself of the types of knowledge on his
acceptance of office.</p>

<p>At about the same period other and more important measures were
adopted for infusing into the service of the State some of that intellectual
vigour which is to be found most abundantly in the main body of
the people. The pontiffs and the augurs had been hitherto chosen
from the patricians alone, when by the Ogulnian law, passed in the
tribuneship of Q. and Cn. Ogulnius, it was enacted that four pontiffs
out of eight, and five augurs out of nine&mdash;at which the numbers were
then fixed&mdash;should be plebeians. The science of augury certainly
required no particular talent; but, as its professors were held in very
high repute, the introduction of the plebeian element into the body,
was a triumph for popular principles. The divining rod in an age of
superstition was also a very powerful rod in the hands of those who
held it; and the privilege of reading or rather interpreting the signs of
the times according to the wish of the interpreter, was a source of so
much influence among a people guided by omens, that the admission of
the plebeians to the exercise of these functions was equivalent to
allowing them an important share in the government.</p>

<p>The science of augury is intimately connected with the history of the
Romans, for they never took a step of a private or a public nature
without consulting the soothsayers, who were, in fact, the fortune-tellers
of antiquity. That a nation should place its destinies in such doubtful
hands, seems in the present day as absurd as if the Prime Minister,
before arranging his measures for a session, were to take counsel with
Dr. Francis Moore, and the Opposition were to frame their tactics on
the advice of Zadkiel. A glimpse at the nature of the art of augury
will demonstrate to the student the ease with which the seer could see
exactly the thing he wanted. The subjects of his observation were,
first, the clouds, which afforded ample opportunity for obscurity;
secondly, the birds, which, when seen to the right, meant exactly
opposite to that which they indicated when seen on the left&mdash;thus
allowing for a good deal to be said on both sides; thirdly, the chickens,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
who were supposed to give a favourable omen if they ate abundantly&mdash;a
theory which gave rise to many a tremendous cram; fourthly, the
quadrupeds, from which the augurs could easily draw a deduction at all
fours with their own wishes; and, fifthly, and last, a miscellaneous class
of signs, or incidents, comprising a sneeze, which enabled the augur to
lead the sneezer by the nose, or a casualty, such as a tumble, which, in
the absence of any other more important sign, the soothsayer was always
willing to fall back upon.</p>

<p>A remarkable instance of ignorance and superstition was afforded by
the conduct of the Romans, when the city, being in about its four
hundred and sixtieth year, was visited by a pestilence. Recourse was
had to the Sibylline books for a prescription to get rid of the plague,
when the augurs, like a doctor who, unable to cure his patient, orders
him abroad, declared that the only thing to be done was to go to
Epidaurus, a town in Greece, and bring to Rome the god Æsculapius.
Ten ambassadors were despatched on the mission; but after looking in
all directions for Æsculapius, they happened to stumble over a stone,
in which they were told he was resident. Having been induced to
purchase the article at a high price, they were taking it on board their
ship, when they fell in with the proprietor of a small menagerie, who,
directing their attention to a tame snake in the collection, offered it to
them a bargain as the identical Æsculapius they were looking for. The
Roman envoys, thinking there might, after all, be nothing in the stone,
concluded there might be something in the snake, which began to twine
itself affectionately about them; and having been bought and paid for,
sagaciously glided through the town, made for the Roman vessel, and
coiled himself up like a coil of rope in the cabin of the ambassadors.</p>

<p>On their way home, a storm caused them to put in at Antium, when
the snake, who might have been a very good snake, but was a very bad
sailor, went ashore, took a turn or two round a palm-tree, hung out
there for three days, and then went back to the vessel. On the arrival
of the ambassadors at Rome, they began describing at some length the
result of their journey, when the snake gave them the slip, and while
their tongues were running on, managed to run off to the island in the
Tiber. Having looked in vain for the snake in the grass, they built a
temple on the spot, in honour of Æsculapius, and the serpent glided on&mdash;no
one knows where&mdash;to the end of his existence.</p>

<p>The wars which had been so exhausting to the almost inexhaustible
Sabines, had been scarcely less ruinous to the Romans, and indeed the
opening up of so many bones of contention had, to use the words of a
recent writer, consumed "the very marrow of the nation."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> In spite of
all their conquests, the people were miserably poor; for destruction, instead
of production, had been their occupation during a series of years;
and though their wants had been supplied for a time by plunder, scarcity
was sure to ensue at last, from a stoppage of the very source of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
wealth, the peaceful exercise of industry. The tide of adversity which,
in the first instance, overwhelms only the lower ranks, rises, with
unerring certainty, until even the highest are absorbed, and few are able,
in the end, to keep their heads above water. When circumstances
appear hopeless, remedies become desperate, rash legislation ensues,
and thus, during the distresses of Rome, the plebs having seceded, a
proposal was adopted, in the shape of the Hortensian Law, to allow them
to do just as they liked, in order to tempt them <a name="back_again" id="back_again"></a>back again.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 407px;">
<img src="images/i_p0133.png" width="407" height="500" alt="The Ambassadors purchasing Æsculapius." title="" />
<span class="caption">The Ambassadors purchasing Æsculapius.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />This was, happily, the last secession of the plebs, who, in their dignified
withdrawal, remained completely within the pale of the law, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
passing beyond the gates of the city. The intention of the seceders
was to get on as they could without the patrician class, leaving the latter
to do their best by themselves&mdash;a proceeding that had speedily the effect
of showing that there is a mutual dependence between all ranks, and
that one cannot exist in comfort without the association and support of
the other. In Rome, the patricians had played the dangerous game of
exercising the rights of their position without fulfilling its duties; and
the plebeians finding themselves deprived of their share of the profits
of the connection, were quite justified in cutting it. After the passing
of the Hortensian Law, the invidious distinction between the patricians
and the people was at an end, and the word <i>populus</i> was applied to the
whole body of citizens; but with the natural tendency of all classes to
level only down to themselves, the Romans who were well to do in the
world continued to use the term <i>plebs</i>, or <i>plebecula</i>, in a depreciatory
sense, to denote the multitude.</p>

<p>It is true, that some works of great utility were accomplished during
the unhappy period to which we have been alluding; and the aqueduct as
well as the Via Appia, to both of which we have already referred, were
executed at the time stated. Instead, however, of being the result of the
free industry of the nation, these undertakings were extorted chiefly from
the labour of the Samnite prisoners; so that the Romans may be said
to have watered their city with the tears, and paved their road with the
sighs,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> of their miserable captives. The arts made considerable progress,
notwithstanding the general poverty, and perhaps the fact, that necessity
is the mother of invention, may account for the stimulus given to the
skill and ingenuity of the nation. The still existing figure, in which
two bronze babies are represented in an attitude of playful satisfaction,
deriving sustenance from a bronze wolf, who looks as easy as the hardness
of the material will allow, has been assigned to the age alluded to,
and the Sarcophagus of Scipio Barbatus, complete even to the ancient
funeral verse, which the irreverent might estimate at the value of an
old song, belongs, probably, to the same period.<br /><br /></p>

repose was broken by the alarm-bell
of war still ringing in its ears, while
dissension, hanging over it like a
nightmare, placed a weight upon its
chest, and became a constant burden
on its resources. As if the Romans
had not enough troubles of their own,
they became involved with the disputes
of their foreign relations, who
were, most of them, very poor relations
indeed&mdash;a sort of connexion
which nations, as well as individuals,
are apt to find extremely burdensome.</p>

<p>A number of petty states began
urging each other to do something
that would embarrass Rome, and
many who had not the courage to
strike were desirous of seeing others
display their valour. The Tarentines
and the Volsinians being anxious
to fight their own battles with other
people's arms, succeeded in making
cats'-paws of the Gauls, who were induced to pounce upon Arretium.
The Romans were appealed to for assistance, and they immediately sent
an army just large enough to be too little. Defeat ensued, as a matter
of course; and L. Cæcilius, the leader, being slain, M. Curius was
despatched to head the troops; but on his arrival, he found there was
no body to which he could serve as a head, for the army had been either
killed or captured.</p>

<p>In this disagreeable dilemma, he sent ambassadors to know the
terms on which the prisoners would be given up; but the ambassadors&mdash;like
good money sent after bad&mdash;never came back again. The
Romans perceiving at last that they were only cutting their army into
convenient pieces for the enemy to swallow up, despatched, at length,
a force large enough to put a stop to any further consumption of such
valuable material. The Romans were now decidedly successful, and
the Senones were, according to certain authorities, "just annihilated;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
but as the Senones are frequently met with again, it must be presumed
that the assertion, <i>ex nihilo nihil fit</i>&mdash;"nothing can come of nothing"&mdash;is
unacknowledged by the writers of classical history.</p>

<p>Foreign intervention seems to have been quite the order of the day;
for the Boians rushed forward to show their sympathy at the fate of the
Senones, which, if it consisted of annihilation, must have been nothing
to the parties themselves, and should have been, <i>à fortiori</i>, nothing
to others. Touched with a similar infection, the Etrurians began
to sympathise with the Boians, and having met the Romans near Lake
Vadimo, the sympathisers were "cut to pieces," if we are to believe
report; but we know not whether to the scissors of the reporters or the
shears of fate, the cutting to pieces in question may be attributed.
The Etruscans, at all events, were able to return to Etruria<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> in
sufficient force to render them a still formidable foe to the Romans,
who were eventually glad to grant a peace on very favourable terms;
and, putting all things together, we are inclined to believe that the
Etruscans were not in that very piecemeal state to which tradition is
fond of reducing them.</p>

<p>A quarrel between the Lucanians and the Thurii caused another
call on the intervention of Rome, who was a thorough polygamist in
espousing the quarrels of others. C. Fabricius was sent to the relief
of Thurii with an army so small, that it began to shrink from the
encounter, and thus increase, as it were, its own littleness. The spirit
of the Romans had something, however, of the caoutchouc in its composition;
for it could be drawn out as easily as it gave in, and a trifling
circumstance showed its elasticity on the occasion of the attack on
Thurii. A gigantic lad, with a ladder in his hand, was seen approaching
the ramparts, which he proceeded to mount, and by this simple act
of scaling the wall, he turned the scale of victory.</p>

<p>The opposing general was taken prisoner, and numbers were left
dead on the field, including several of the Samnites, who in devoting
themselves to glut the appetite of war, appear to have formed the
great <i>pièce de résistance</i> of the period. The feast of carnage seems
never to have been complete in these days, without this very substantial
dish, which seems to have formed literally an instance of "cut and
come again," for we find a supply of Samnites always ready for fate's
relentless carving-knife. The treasure taken by Fabricius, the Roman
general, was immense, and much of it was derived from the inexhaustible
Samnites, who, though constantly being cut up like the goose with the
golden eggs, possessed one extraordinary advantage over that auriferous
bird, for they could bear the operation as often as avarice itself could
require. The booty was wonderful in amount; but the mode in which it
was disposed of, was more marvellous still; for the general, instead of
following the general custom, by pocketing all he could, distributed
a large portion of it among the soldiers, reimbursed the amount of a
year's taxes to the citizens, and sent a handsome surplus to the treasury.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
It is to be regretted that we have no such examples of justice and
generosity in the present age; for if every man were to return as
conscience money to the Exchequer all that he did not fairly earn, the
National Debt might soon figure&mdash;without any figures at all&mdash;as a
myth in our financial annals.</p>

<p>Thurii received a small Roman garrison, which not being strong
enough to defend itself, was <i>à fortiori</i>, or rather <i>ab impotentiori</i>, too
weak to protect those for whose safety it had been appointed. Rome,
therefore, despatched ten ships to its aid, in defiance of a treaty with
Tarentum, that no armed vessel should proceed beyond a certain point.
The people of Tarentum, who happened to be at the theatre, which
commanded a view of the sea, and who were evidently looking at the
ocean as a much finer spectacle than the play, observed the approach of
the ships, and leaving the actors to finish their performance to empty
benches, they rushed out to meet the enemy. The commander of the
squadron was not prepared for an audience that would hear nothing he
had to say, the sailors were alarmed at finding themselves suddenly
assailed, and the poor rowers were completely overawed at their unexpected
position. Only five ships escaped, the remainder being sunk or
captured, with all their crews and cargoes. The Tarentines fell upon
Thurii, whose cause was now completely undefended; but the Roman
garrison, instead of being despatched by the sword, was generously
despatched home by the earliest means of conveyance.</p>

<p>The Romans, having lost a considerable number of men, thought it
better to recruit themselves by peace, as they were unable to find
recruits for their army. It was accordingly determined to try the effect
of an embassy upon the Tarentines, and some Feciales were employed
to propose&mdash;what Rome considered&mdash;very moderate terms of arrangement.
L. Postumius is said to have been one of the envoys, and it is
added that upon his commencing a speech in bad Greek, there was a
burst of laughter at his mistakes in grammar, orthography, and accent.
He had been selected for the charm of his eloquence, but the spell was
broken by the spelling, and in the confusion of his nominatives and
datives, he was unable to make out a case of any kind. The Senators
gave way to bursts of laughter&mdash;those bursts of nature which it is
often difficult to control&mdash;and a buffoon, encouraged by the bad example
of his betters, played some practical joke upon L. Postumius. The
insulted emissary immediately held up his toga, which had been soiled
by the jester, whose wit seems to have consisted in throwing dirt; but
a shout of laughter was the only reply that the complaint of Postumius
elicited. Desiring them to laugh on, he made an allusion to the possibility
of the operation being transferred to the other side of the Roman
mouth, and he added that a lavatory supplied by their blood was the only
wash to which he would send his toga. Returning to Rome, he pointed
out the stain that had been thrown upon him, and the Senate declared
war on the spot the moment the spot was exhibited. An army was
accordingly sent against Tarentum, but the leader, L. Aemilius Barbula,&mdash;so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
called probably from his being the little-bearded or the downy one&mdash;offered
peace a second time. The Tarentines, thinking the Romans were
afraid of fighting, refused to come to terms; but seeing that the latter
did not retire, it became necessary to seek assistance in meeting them.</p>

<p>It appears that in these early days there were a set of persons willing
to undertake butchery as a trade, by hiring themselves, or rather
lowering themselves, to fight for any one who would pay them. Among
these, one of the most respectable was Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, whom
we may almost regard as a professional spiller of blood, for he took care
to turn his labours to a profitable account, by bleeding those on whose
side he fought, as well as those he fought against. According to some
writers, Pyrrhus was no mercenary, because in agreeing to lend his
arms to the Tarentines, he had in view a kingdom, rather than cash, or,
in other words, he did not propose to be paid by those whom he assisted,
because he intended to appropriate to himself everything out of which
they would have the means of paying him. Pyrrhus, in fact, can only
be excluded from the order of mercenaries by transferring him to the
catalogue of thieves, and of this arrangement we have no objection to
give him the benefit.</p>

<p>Though he lived in an age when the education of sovereigns was
sadly neglected, he possessed a fair amount of information, and he had
the fortunate habit of listening to good advice, so that he got credit for
being wise on the strength of the wisdom of his counsellors. His tongue
was no less polished than his sword, and his manners would have fully
justified their being charged as extras in the bill of any school in which
they may have been acquired. He was only thirty-seven years old when
he entered Italy with a stud, including no less than twenty elephants
and two thousand horses, though he was, of course, the principal lion of
his great travelling menagerie. He was accompanied by a vast number
of slingers, whose arms were in their slings, and a large body of bowmen,
who could draw the longest bow with a truthfulness quite astonishing.
An incident connected with the invocation of the aid of Pyrrhus by the
Tarentines has come down to us by tradition, that common carrier who
lays much at the historian's door, that he is not always inclined to
answer for. It is said that a respectable young nobleman, of the name
of Meto, appeared one day in the Tarentine senate with a quantity of
faded flowers in his hair, as if he had just come home late from a dinner
party, and had passed on his way through one of the markets. Being
attended by a female with a pipe, the Tarentines were seized with a
sudden desire to cheer, a propensity still evinced by a modern mob in
the presence of any <a name="absurdity" id="absurdity"></a>absurdity.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">

" title="" />
<span class="caption">

</span>
</div>



<p><br /><br />The excitement at length broke out into a general demand for a
dance, and a shout arose similar to the unmeaning cry of "Hornpipe!"
that is heard in a modern theatre on the first performance of a pantomime.
The young noble, feeling that he might be involved in an
extraordinary caper, seems to have suddenly resumed his senses; for he
exclaimed with a serious air, "Yes, we must dance and feast now, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Pyrrhus will soon put an end to all our merriment." The words of
Meto seemed too prophetic; for Pyrrhus had no sooner arrived, than, on
the principle, perhaps, that where there is a great deal of work, there
should be no play, he shut up the theatre of the Tarentines. He stopped
everything in the shape of amusement, and the young noble's prediction
as to the city's dancing days being nearly over, was completely verified.
It would certainly have been better for Pyrrhus in the end had he
listened in the beginning to his counsellor, Cineas, who, according to
Plutarch, talked the matter over with his royal master, in the most
familiar manner possible. "Now, tell me," said Cineas, "supposing
our expedition to be successful, what will be the next step?" a query
which elicited from Pyrrhus a whole catalogue of arduous exploits,
which he had in contemplation. "Very good," said the sage, "and
when all is conquered, what then?"&mdash;"What then?" responded
Pyrrhus, "why, then, of course, we can take our ease, drink, and be
merry."&mdash;"True enough," rejoined Cineas, "but why not take your
ease, drink, and be merry at once, without all the preliminary toils and
dangers you propose to undergo, and by which you only postpone,
instead of advancing, your ultimate object?" Unfortunately Pyrrhus,
like many others, failed to see the force of this kind of reasoning, and
he continued to encounter immediate peril and fatigue, with the remote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
prospect of future repose, which there was nothing to prevent his taking
at once if he had really set his <a name="head_on_it" id="head_on_it"></a>head on it.<br /><br /></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">

</div>

<p><br /><br />Though he would not acknowledge himself to be convinced by the
arguments of the philosopher, it is probable that Pyrrhus secretly
felt the value of the advice that had been given him; for his
first step was a proposal to treat; and he even offered a draft by
way of preliminary, but the Roman Consul rejected the proffered
measure. The armies accordingly met on the banks of the Siris, a
small river near Heraclea, and Pyrrhus sent a spy with a spy-glass,
to inspect the position of the enemy. The spy was immediately spied
out on the other side, and arrested forthwith, so that the look-out
of the spy appeared utterly deplorable. Having, however, been shown
everything there was to be seen in the Roman camp, as if he had been
a traveller in search of information, instead of a sneak traversing a
hostile area, the spy was sent back with care&mdash;right side upwards, which
he scarcely deserved&mdash;to his master. This incident elicited from Pyrrhus
the remark, that "the barbarians had an exceedingly gentlemanly way
of conducting a war;" and the next day being fixed for the battle, he
felt that he should have the satisfaction of a gentleman in going out
with them.</p>

<p>The attack was commenced by the Romans; and the Consul, resolving
either to sink or swim, sent a body of cavalry across the river. Pyrrhus,
putting himself at the head of his horse, proceeded to meet the charge,
but he soon perceived that his brilliant armour was rendering him
uncomfortably conspicuous, and he exchanged his dazzling coat of mail for
an old rusty suit worn by his friend Megacles. The latter was perhaps
proud to wear the trappings of royalty, but the emptiness of false glitter
was speedily exemplified, for Megacles being mistaken for the king, was
killed, and the shining armour was carried in triumph to the enemy's
camp before the hollow mockery was discovered.</p>

<p>The battle was fought with determined bravery on both sides, but
brute force decided it at last, for the elephants of Pyrrhus weighed
immensely in the scale of victory. The creatures coming down <i>en
masse</i>, were more effective than the heaviest of ordinary heavies, and
advancing with all their might upon the horses, the latter, though resisting
with all their mane, felt their animal spirits rapidly oozing out
of them. The carnage committed upon the Romans would have been
merciless and complete, had it not been for the humanity of one of the
elephants, who, taking a benevolent turn, pulled himself short round,
and prevented his own side from continuing the pursuit of the fugitives.
Pyrrhus, having laid his hands on everything he could take, proceeded
to take everything he could lay his hands upon. A rich harvest having
been collected, he, on the day following, went to glean what he could on
the field of battle. Perceiving that the Romans had all fallen with
their eyes towards the foe, he could not but acknowledge, with so much
bravery staring him in the face, the courage of his antagonists. "With
such soldiers as these," he exclaimed, "the world would be mine, or, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
all events, it would be theirs if I were their general." He had, however,
lost half his own men; and as they lay prostrate before him, they
seemed to offer a flat contradiction to the congratulations offered to him
on his victory. "Another such a triumph," he replied, "and I should
return to Epirus thoroughly unmanned, for there would not remain to
me a single soldier." He offered to the prisoners employment in his
own army, but they, without exception, refused; and, considering their
conduct unexceptionable, he had their chains taken off, that they
might feel themselves quite unfettered in their future movements. He
burned the bodies of the dead, out of compliment to their remains,
whose combustion, could they have acted for themselves, would no
doubt have been spontaneous. He made a tolerably fair division of the
spoil, giving some to his allies, and devoted a considerable slice to Zeus&mdash;a
piece of devotion of which the priests of the temple got the chief
benefit.</p>

<p>The policy of Pyrrhus was to turn old foes into new friends; and he
sent his trusty counsellor, Cineas, to Rome, with a suggestion that
all animosity should be buried in the graves of those who had fallen on
both sides. The Senators were beginning to waver, when Appius
Claudius the Blind&mdash;who had been carried down to the house by his
four sons&mdash;an arrangement that suggests the picture of a veteran
supported by a youth at each arm and at each leg&mdash;declared suddenly
that he could see through the whole affair, and called upon the
Romans to open their eyes to the designs of Pyrrhus. The veteran,
who, from infirmity, was unable to stir without assistance, could still
agitate with his tongue; he urged that the proposals of Cineas should
be rejected; and the assembly having first carried the motion, carried
home the mover in triumph.</p>

<p>Cineas, on returning to his master, described the city as a temple,
and the Senate as an assembly of kings; for he could not get the
temples out of his head; and the magnificent curule chairs kept
reminding him of the dignified setting down he had received from the
Senators.</p>

<p>Pyrrhus, finding his friendly advances repulsed, resolved on advancing
upon Rome in a less amicable spirit. Proceeding towards Capua, he
encountered Laevinius, the consul, whom he had on a previous occasion
beaten; but he was now not quite so fortunate; for, after a severe
contest, neither side could say exactly which had got the worst of it.
Pyrrhus, however, marched upon Praeneste, which fell into his hands,
in consequence of the Romans having let it slip through their fingers.
From the acropolis of Praeneste he is said to have seen Rome, at a
distance of eighteen miles; but he must have seen very little, if so far
off, unless he was accustomed to magnify what he saw in a very remarkable
manner. The sight was sufficiently imposing to cause him to
retreat; and he went into winter quarters at Tarentum, where he spent
his own time, and the money he had taken from the <a name="enemy" id="enemy"></a>enemy.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 441px;">
<img src="images/i_p0142.png" width="441" height="550" alt="Self-possession of Fabricius, the Ambassador, under rather Trying Circumstances." title="" />
<span class="caption">Self-possession of Fabricius, the Ambassador, under rather Trying Circumstances.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />While Pyrrhus was thus engaged, or rather disengaged, three ambassadors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
named C. Fabricius, Q. A. Papus, and P. Dolabella, were sent
to him from Rome, to negotiate for the release of prisoners. C. Fabricius
was a very superior man; and Pyrrhus, thinking to gain over the
superior man, employed means by which none but a very inferior individual
was at all likely to be influenced. Bribery was the first expedient
attempted by Pyrrhus; but C. Fabricius showed his contempt for
money by pursing his eyebrows. Having failed in his coarse appeal to
avarice, Pyrrhus tried what was to be done through fear; and one day
a <i>tête-à-tête</i> between the king and the ambassador was disturbed by the
sudden introduction of a third <i>tête</i>, in the shape of the head of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
elephant. The sagacious brute stood concealed behind a curtain, and,
with a blow of the trunk on the cheek, he administered a smart box on
the ear to the startled ambassador. The animal accompanied the act
with a hideous roar, and threw his trunk over the head of C. Fabricius,
who remained for a moment unable to see the clumsy joke that was
being played upon him. He, nevertheless, retained his self-possession,
remarking simply that neither by throwing gold dust in his eyes, nor
by the still blacker job of the elephant's trunk, was he to be blinded
to his duty.</p>

<p>Though Pyrrhus would not accede to the terms proposed for ransoming
the Roman prisoners, he allowed them to go to Rome, for the
season, to be present at the celebration of the <i>fêtes</i> of the Saturnalia.
These games appear to have included some rather melancholy mirth,
the principal fun of the affair consisting in the practice of shouting out
"Io!"&mdash;which is equivalent to "Go it!"&mdash;in the public thoroughfare.
Presents were exchanged among friends; and servants were in the
habit of offering wax candles to their masters,&mdash;a sort of composition,
perhaps, which the former came to with their consciences, in memory of
the enormities of the grease pot. The domestic was allowed to wear his
employer's clothes; and this portion of the ceremonies of the Saturnalia
is still privately observed by the gentleman's gentleman of the family.
While the wardrobe of the master remained at the mercy of the valet,
the synthesis, or dressing-gown, was the fashionable attire; and for a
period of general relaxation, this loose wrapper was perfectly appropriate.</p>

<p>Having done at Rome as Rome was doing, during the Saturnalia, the
prisoners returned to Pyrrhus, who opened the campaign in Apulia,
and met the two Roman consuls&mdash;P. Sulpicius, and P. Decius Mus&mdash;at
Asculum. This Mus is the third to which the labours of the historical
muse have given birth; and he is said to have shared the fate of
his grandfather and father&mdash;if at least that fate can be said to have been
"shared," of which each had to bear the whole inconvenience. The
battle fought at Asculum was severe, the Romans having lost
6000 men; for tradition delights in round numbers, with which
probability often refuses to square; and no less than three thousand
five hundred and five&mdash;for in this case exactness is carried to a degree
of excess&mdash;are said to have fallen on the side of Pyrrhus.</p>

<p>War was found to be doing its usual work, the sword was cutting both
ways at once; the candle was burning away at both ends, and the
litigants were figuratively cutting their own throats, as well as those of
their enemies. Each party would have backed out, if he could have
seen his way, when an incident occurred that opened the door to a compromise.
Pyrrhus had a medical attendant; who, perhaps, felt that
doctor's work might as well be done at first as at last, and offered to
poison by one dose, instead of by slow degrees, his illustrious patient.
The medical traitor accordingly prepared a draft, which he knew he
could persuade Pyrrhus to accept; but the Romans rejected the idea
with scorn, and denounced the scoundrel, who when taken was severely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
shaken by his indignant countrymen. The wretch at first denied having
written the prescription, and attempted to eat his own words; but they
stuck in his throat, and he died from the physical impossibility of getting
them either one way or the other.</p>

<p>Pyrrhus was so pleased with the treatment of the empiric who
would have poisoned him, that he sent back all his prisoners to Rome
without ransom, togged<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> out in new togas, and attended by pages,
stitched in neat wrappers. After some negotiation, which was assisted
by the returned prisoners, who urged their own new suits in support of
that of Pyrrhus, now eager for peace, a truce for four years was agreed
upon. It was stipulated that he should leave Italy, and he took the
opportunity to cross to Sicily with the benevolent intention of freeing
the people from the Carthaginian yoke; but, like most foreign liberators,
if he took off an old yoke with one hand, he had in the other a new
apparatus, which he was anxious to substitute. His object was to have
made himself master of the place; but after remaining three years, he
began to lament the faithlessness of friends, and helping himself to as
much booty as he could lay his hands upon, he left the Sicilians to
deplore the loss of himself and the treasure he took away with him.
He had, in fact, been sent for by the Tarentines, and was on his way to
see what he could do for them, when he was met by a Carthaginian
fleet, which sank seventy of his ships&mdash;as we are told by the same
authority that represents him to have started with only sixty,&mdash;a fact
which leaves little doubt as to which party profited most by the friendship
between Pyrrhus and the people of Sicily. He suffered a further
loss in the mountain passes, where he had some very narrow escapes;
but he nevertheless continued to keep a balance of 20,000 foot, and
3000 horse for the purpose of meeting any future engagements.</p>

<p>On his arrival at Tarentum, there was such a panic among the
Romans that nobody would enlist, until Curius Dentatus announced his
intention of confiscating the property of the first who refused to enter
the rank that was open to him. Besides the panic caused by the name of
Pyrrhus, an alarm had sprung up in consequence of the head of the
god Summanus having been struck off his statue by lightning, and
nobody could ascertain what had become of it. Accident led to its
discovery in the bed of the Tiber, from which it had probably been
fished by one of those extraordinary hooks which so many of our
historical facts are found to hang upon. The augurs were consulted as
a matter of course, and on a case being submitted to their opinion, they
advised that the action against Pyrrhus should be carried on; for,
according to the soothsayers, the loss and subsequent finding of the
head, proved that after hair-breadth escapes victory would crown their
<a name="labours" id="labours"></a>labours.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<span class="caption">Discovery of the Head of Summanus.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />Pyrrhus in the mean time marched to Beneventum to attack Curius,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
intending to surprise the latter by sending, through a mountain pass,
some troops and elephants. The idea of a short cut for these massive
brutes was absurd, and the unwieldy bulk of the elephants caused a succession
of stoppages in the highways and byeways through which they
were being driven. The Greek columns got occasionally into a fearful
fix, and it was with difficulty they could lug through the mountain pass
their extremely bulky luggage. Instead of completing their journey by
night, it was daylight before they had commenced their descent on
Curius, who saw them at a distance, and prepared a warm reception for
the elephants. He attacked them with burning arrows, and lighted
barrels of tar, which were pitched among the poor brutes, who fell back
upon their own camp, and every tent was turned into a crush-room.
Several elephants were killed, and four, being taken alive, were made
to march as prisoners in the Consul's triumph. Pyrrhus reached
Tarentum with a handful of horse, and a pocket-full of bread; but,
being unable to pay the salaries of his adherents, they soon fell away in
the absence of the usual golden rivets. He retired to Greece, where
he engaged in all sorts of adventures, till the want of money prevented
him from carrying on the war in any shape; and it is said that he had
come down, at last, to such very petty disputes, that he died of a blow
on the head, from a stone aimed at him in a street-row by an angry
woman. On the death of Pyrrhus, those whom he had assisted
relinquished all hope of maintaining themselves against such a
formidable enemy as Rome, and the Lucanians, Bruttians, and Samnites
proceeded to do homage to a power they had been in the habit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
defying as long as they had any one on their side strong enough to
assist them in fighting their battles. The Samnite ambassadors, who
were entrusted with the humiliating duty of conveying the submission
of their countrymen to Curius Dentatus, found him at his Sabine farm,
engaged in the discussion of a large dish of turnips. He received the
envoys with no other form than a wooden one, upon which he was
seated, and he continued his vegetarian meal, as he listened to their
overtures. They offered to bribe him with gold; but, taking up a
spoonful of the mashed turnips, he declared that, as long as he could
make sure of his daily bunch of his favourite luxury, wealth had no
charms for him.<br /><br /></p>

</div>

<p><br /><br />The Samnites made one more desperate effort against Rome, and
Lollius, a runaway hostage, who had escaped to his native mountains,
found life such thoroughly up-hill work, that he resolved to change it, or
part with it. Having got round him a band of robbers, who were just
the sort of persons to do everything by stealth, he secretly prepared to
attack the Romans; but they, hearing of the approach of the marauders,
were early in the field, and, securing the leaders of the insurrection,
struck off their heads in order to break the neck of it.</p>

<p>Rome was now mistress of Italy, but her ambition, which, though
always vaulting, knew no bounds, would not allow her to keep her
empire within its natural limits. In the management of her conquered
possessions she affected much generosity, in professing to admit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
vanquished to a share of her own advantages,&mdash;an operation she effected
by taking all the advantages to herself in the first instance, and then
conveying a small moiety back to those from whom they had been
wrested.</p>

<p>The Colonial system pursued by Rome was peculiar, for instead of
selecting uninhabited places, she preferred a population ready made,
possessing wealth already acquired, of which she usually helped herself
to a full third in exchange for a Government, which she supplied from
her own large stock of persons in want of places. The relationship
between Rome and her colonies has been compared to that of parent
and child; but considering the stripping process to which Rome had
recourse, she seems to have acted less as a mother than a kidnapper.
The Roman Constitution, like the Roman cement, was an excellent
compound, of which it is impossible to describe the ingredients; and,
indeed, it is found that the best Constitutions&mdash;like our own British&mdash;are
those which cannot be defined by a written prescription, or made
the subject of a perfect analysis. There was a judicious spreading of
political power over a considerable surface, and thus&mdash;to use a figure
from the chemist's shop&mdash;a plaster was always ready to be applied
to the sores, or even the trifling eruptions that might make their
appearance on any portion of the great body of the nation.</p>

<p>As in our own admirable form of government, there were three
estates, comprising the people, the senate, and the executive; but the
want of a permanent and universally recognised head of the state,
kept the country continually exposed to agitation on the part of
designing demagogues.</p>

<p>As the sword, unfortunately, cuts the most prominent figure in
the early history of Rome, we must not omit to speak of its military
organisation, which was very complete; for in early times there seemed
to be an impression that neighbours ought to be approached with the
arm of war, rather than with the hand of friendship. Every Roman
citizen was a soldier, and was liable at any moment to be called upon
to turn his ploughshare into a sword, though when his special service
was over he was at liberty to turn his sword back again into a ploughshare.
This transformation was not effected without damage to the
instrument, and the ordinary operations of agriculture were frequently
interrupted by calling the labourer from the garden to the field, and
forcing him to drill when engaged in sowing broad-cast. We have in a
single chapter of Livy<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> an account of what a Roman army consisted
of during the great Latin war, and though learned writers<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> have snarled
and quarrelled over the materials, like dogs over a dry and meatless
bone, we quietly walk into the midst of them, and deliberately extract
the marrow. An army may be described in half-a-dozen lines, though
it consisted of five, which were termed respectively, <i>Hastati</i>, <i>Principes</i>,
<i>Triarii</i>, <i>Rorarii</i>, and <i>Accensi</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>
<p>The <i>Hastati</i>, so called from their carrying the <i>hasta</i> or spear, consisted
of youth in the bloom of early manhood, and who went in front,
that their early bloom might encounter the first blow of the enemy.
The next row was formed of the <i>Principes</i>, or men in the vigour of
life, distinguished by the abundance and splendour of their shields,
arms, and accoutrements, and comprising what may be termed the
heavy swells of the army. Next in order came the <i>Triarii</i>, a body of
veterans, selected for their past experience&mdash;a quality which, however
valuable in council, may be often useless in war; for though experience
might have told a veteran that he ought to run for his life, his heels,
being as old as his head, might have refused to do the latter's bidding.
The fourth rank was composed of <i>Rorarii</i>, from the word <i>Rora</i>, dew,
who sprinkled the enemy with various missiles, and who standing
behind the <i>Triarii</i>, must occasionally, by aiming short of the foe, have
given more than their due to the veterans immediately in front of them.
Last in order came the <i>Accensi</i>, or supernumeraries, whose courage and
fidelity were not of the highest class, and who either brought up the
rear or left it behind, as their resolution urged them on, or their want
of it kept them back, while there was always an opening left in case
their fears should run away with them. It was frequently the practice
of the <i>Accensi</i> to reserve the vacant back-ground as a sort of race-course,
in which races between their valour and their discretion were being
continually run, and in the majority of cases the latter got by far the
best of it.</p>

<p>The habits of the early Romans were extremely simple; agriculture
was their most honoured employment; and it was thought high praise
to say of any man, that he was a good husband, and a good husbandman.
Their food was chiefly corn; and many a happy family afforded an
illustration of the fact that love, notwithstanding the assertion of the
song writer to the contrary, can sometimes live on flour. Wine was so
precious, that, in libations to the gods, it was poured out drop by drop,
to prevent their getting a drop too much; and, indeed, so scarce was it
in the early days of Rome, that Romulus is said to have used milk in
his sacrifices; while Papirius, at a later period, vowed, in the event of
his victory over the Samnites, a small glass&mdash;or <i>petit verre</i>&mdash;to Jupiter.</p>

<p>Long beards were worn by the Romans until the arrival of a Greek
barber from Sicily; and he is said to have plucked out, with a pair of
tweezers, the beard which had grown for four centuries and a half into
a rooted habit. On some he employed the razor, and he was able to
reap an abundant harvest from the chins of a people who had never yet
worn a smooth-faced aspect.</p>

<p>The invasion of Pyrrhus caused the adoption at Rome of many
Grecian luxuries, and among others was the luxury of substituting
a silver coinage for copper, which had been found so inconvenient that
a rich man had been obliged to use a wagon instead of a purse, if he
wished to take his money about with him. Silver was, however, so
scarce, that one Cornelius Rufinus was turned out of the Senate for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
having on his sideboard more than ten pounds of plate; for it was
believed that he could not have come honestly by so much of it, and he
was regarded as either a thief, or at least as a receiver of stolen
property.</p>

<p>So humble were the pretensions to display in those early days, that a
silver cup and a salt-cellar formed, usually, the entire contents of a
Roman noble's plate-basket. Music, among the early Romans, was at
the lowest possible pitch, and the only professors were flute-players, of
scarcely any note, from Etruria. Their strains were so dismal as to
be employed only at a sacrifice or a funeral, when extreme melancholy
was required. On one occasion the band is said to have struck, and
retired to Tibur, when the musicians were only brought back by being
made helplessly drunk,&mdash;a weakness to which some of those hirelings
who assist at the performance of funerals are in our day liable.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br />CHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH.</h2>

<h3>THE FIRST PUNIC WAR.<br /><br /></h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">

<p><span style="margin-left:-2em" class="smcap">ll</span> Italy now belonged to Rome,
but the thirst for conquest was
not quenched even by the sea
itself, beyond which the Romans
prepared to extend their power.
Among those who made a business
of bloodshed, by lending
themselves out as soldiers to any
one who paid them, the Campanians
enjoyed&mdash;if there could
have been any real enjoyment
in the matter&mdash;a bad eminence.
They had followed the trade of human butchers for about fifty years;
and, among other sanguinary engagements, they had accepted a job
from the tyrant<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> of Syracuse.</p>

<p>The Campanians had done their work of devastation; and there being
no further use for them, they had received notice to quit; but instead
of returning home, they resolved to stay, and perpetrate a little plunder
for their own exclusive benefit. They accordingly surprised the town
of Messana&mdash;if any enormity may be considered surprising, when committed
by such a set&mdash;and calling themselves the Sons of Mamers, or
Mars, they established themselves under the title of the Republic of the
Mamertines. From this point they carried on their trade of robbery
and murder, which they put in practice right and left, upon most of
their neighbours. On the unerring principle, that wrong never comes
right, the rulers of Syracuse, who had, for their own bad purposes,
introduced the Campanians into the place, became, in turn, the victims
of that lawless band of freebooters. At length, Hiero, a king of Syracuse,
determined on getting rid of the nuisance which his predecessors
had established, and fell upon the Mamertines with such effect, that
they were on the point of being crushed, when they were saved by the
interference of a Carthaginian Admiral. The Mamertines being themselves
faithless, were suspicious of every one else, and were as false to
each other as they were untrue to all besides; so that they looked
distrustingly on the offer made, and were unable to agree as to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
policy of accepting it. They were speedily in the position of a house
divided, for some were ready to receive the protection of Carthage,
while others sent for help to the Romans, who, to their utter disgrace,
passed a decree, pledging themselves to an alliance with the Mamertine
miscreants. It must be stated, to the honour of the Senate, that a
majority of that body rejected the humiliating proposal with scorn; but
the Consuls, desirous of giving <i>éclat</i> to their term of office&mdash;an evil
incidental to the system of having a temporary, instead of a permanent,
head to the state&mdash;did all they could to plunge the country into a war,
and brought the question before the assembly of the people.</p>

<p>The lower passions of pride and avarice are soon aroused among the
mass by specious promises of glory and conquest; and though each man
might, for himself, have spurned an alliance with the Mamertine
mercenaries, the result proved the truth of the saying, that "a corporation
will do what an individual will shrink from with shame;" for the
Comitia Tributa voted that the disgraceful compact should be formed.</p>

<p>Appius Claudius, the son of the blind Consul, was sent to Messana
with a fleet of <span class="smcap">TRIREMES</span>, or vessels with three ranks of oars, which had
been borrowed from the Greek towns of Italy; for the Roman Admiralty,
in the true spirit of a board, though continually building ships,
was unable to produce an effective navy. Appius Claudius was not
seaman enough to carry his <span class="smcap">TRIREMES</span> to Sicily, and his rowers were not
so expert as they should have been in the management of the oars,
which were placed in ranks, one above the other, to a considerable
height, so that a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull altogether was
extremely difficult.</p>

<p>Having at last got near enough for a parley, he invited Hanno, the
Carthaginian general, to a conference; and, finding him a weak and
nervous person, he seized him by the neck, and fairly shook the whole
of his resolution out of him.</p>

<p>Hanno was frightened into delivering up the citadel, and returning
to Carthage, he was hurried off to speedy execution, for having failed in
the execution of his duty. King Hiero, being deprived of his Carthaginian
aid, was completely beaten, and was glad to offer peace, or
rather he was glad to get it, on any conditions, for his own condition
was truly deplorable. He paid down 200 talents in ready money,
which was equivalent to about fifty thousand pounds of our modern
coin, to prevent the sacking of Syracuse, and by sacrificing all his cash in
hand, he was able to save his capital. From this period may be dated
the commencement of the first Punic War; and as a feeble-minded
reader may be dwelling on the word Punic, in the silly expectation of a
pun, we, by explaining that it is derived from Ph&#339;nicia, whence
Ph&#339;nic or Punic, at once check the morbid appetite. The city of
Carthage is said to have been about one hundred years older than
Rome; but cities, like ladies beyond a certain date, baffle all attempts
to reduce their age to a matter of certainty. Tradition assigns the
foundation of Carthage to Dido, who, having been converted into an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
unprotected female by the murder of her husband, fled from Tyre,
and when completely tired out, sat down to rest on the coast of Africa.
Here she agreed to take, on a building lease, as much land as could be
covered with a bull's hide, when, to the astonishment of the lessor, she
produced a skin cut up into thongs, and acting as her own surveyor,
she claimed to be monarch of all she surveyed, by putting this new
species of leathern girdle round as much earth as possible. There
was certainly less of the princess than of the tradeswoman in this
transaction, which, however, was characteristic of the future city, for it
became famous for its business and its bargains, as well as infamous for
its bad faith; the term <i>Punica fides</i> having become a by-word to
express the grossest dishonesty. Her devotion to commerce led to
the establishment of a powerful navy, and her citizens having something
more profitable to do than to fight, her army was always hired from
abroad when occasion required. Rome, on the other hand, had made
war her chief pursuit, and the consequence was, that she had plenty of
soldiers, but no ships, except a few she had taken from her foes; and
her occupations being mostly of a military or destructive kind, she had
no resources but her valour to rely upon.</p>

<p>The Romans remained in Sicily, where several powers claimed their
protection; but Hannibal Gisco, anxious to preserve Agrigentum, threw
himself and sixty elephants into it. Here he was besieged for seven
months with an army of 50,000 men, who, of course, consumed daily
a large quantity of food; but there was something utterly irrational in
providing daily rations for sixty elephants. It was arranged, therefore,
that Hanno should proceed to the relief of Agrigentum, but he was
defeated with the loss of thirty elephants, left dead on the field&mdash;a
field which must have been necessarily a very wide one for conjecture.
Hannibal Gisco's army consisted of a medley of mercenaries, including
some Gauls, who, having much money owing to them, refused to strike,
except for their pay, and who intimated that they would not draw their
swords until they had drawn their salaries. Their general, unable to
settle with them in cash, chose a more treacherous way of paying
them off; for, getting them into an ambush, he caused a volley of
missiles to be aimed at them, and the discharge was in full of all
demands, for it effectually stopped all further clamour.</p>

<p>Agrigentum was plundered by the Romans, who sold 25,000 of the
inhabitants for slaves&mdash;at least, according to tradition, who usually deals
in round numbers, amounting often in value to the sum which a
perfectly round number or figure indicates.</p>

<p>Though the Carthaginians had failed on land, their fleet gave them
advantages at sea, for there the Romans were completely out of their
element. The latter, however, resolved to have a navy of their own,
and the Board of Admiralty set to work in good earnest, with the cooperation
of the Woods and Forests, which supplied the requisite timber.
The difficulty now felt, was to obtain a design upon which to build, and
instead of trusting to official surveyors, who might have shown plenty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of cunning, without producing any craft, the Romans took for a model
a Carthaginian quinquereme that had come ashore on the coast of
Bruttium. Being relieved from the supervision of the professional
architects, the ship-building progressed rapidly, and within sixty days
after the trees had been felled, one hundred and thirty ships were built;
though the builders must have been as green as the wood, and as crazy
as the craft, to have imagined that such a fleet could have any but the
most fleeting existence. While the vessels were being got ready, it
occurred to the authorities that crews would be required, and as
the Romans had as yet neither ships nor sailors, a few scaffolds
were erected on land, that the intended tars might try their hands
at naval <a name="tactics" id="tactics"></a>tactics.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Roman Man-of-War, from a scarce Medal.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />Matters went smoothly enough on shore, till the would-be seamen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
having ventured out to sea, found themselves as ignorant as babies, when
rocked in the cradle of the deep; and as the waves washed over them,
they perceived they had learnt nothing of their new art but its driest
details. With seventeen of these queer quinqueremes, each with 300
rowers, who by their misunderstandings kept up a continual but useless
row, the Consul, Cn. Cornelius Scipio, sailed for Messana, when the Punic
Captain Bugud, a regular Carthaginian tar, sent him flying, with half
his timbers shivered, into a port of the Lipari. The crews, most of
them half dead with sea sickness, scrambled as well as they could on
shore. Their commander, Cn. Scipio, was taken prisoner, and so
ridiculous had been the figure he cut, that his countrymen conferred
upon him the name of Asina&mdash;or the donkey&mdash;a character that
might in these days have qualified him for an appointment to a
jackass frigate.</p>

<p>After this ludicrous defeat, the command of the Roman navy was
taken by the other Consul, C. Duilius, who determined to wash out in
the ocean, as well as he could, the stain thrown upon his countrymen.
He felt that naval tactics were out of the question among those who
were, in one sense, sailors of the first water, for they had never been on
the water before; and as to rowing, he knew it to be so impracticable that
he resolved to throw the oars overboard. He hit on an expedient for
making a naval engagement resemble as much as possible a fight on
shore; and by overcoming in some respect the inequalities of the
waves, he put his own men on nearly the same footing with the enemy.
He constructed boarding bridges, capable of holding two or three persons
abreast, and these bridges being thrown on to the enemy's ships, enabled
the Romans to walk into them.</p>

<p>The Carthaginians who were not prepared for such close quarters, and
had trusted rather to the roughness of the sea, to deprive their opponents
of an even chance of success, were so thoroughly taken by surprise,
that they suffered their ships to be taken one after the other. C. Duilius
was handsomely rewarded for his victory; he was hailed as the first naval
hero that Rome had introduced, and as if the festive propensities of a
sailor on shore had been foreseen, he was allowed the curious privilege
of being accompanied home at night from banquets by an attendant
with a torch&mdash;in which we see a foreshadowing of the policeman and
the bull's-eye. He was further honoured by a <i>columna rostrata</i>, a sort of
Nelson Column, adorned with the beaks of ships&mdash;a short stumpy looking
affair, of which the museum at Rome contains an imitation from the
hand of Michael Angelo,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>&mdash;who has afforded us a fair copy of one
of the columns of the Times, in which the deeds of great men were
advertised.</p>

<p>This nautical exploit of Rome was followed up by minor successes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and L. Scipio made an attack upon Corsica, where he was opposed by a
Carthaginian fleet, under the command of Hannibal Gisco, who was
killed by his own men, but honourably entombed by the Romans, who
nobly buried their former animosity.</p>

<p>Carthage and Rome were mutually suffering by their hostilities, and
each nation lost its thousands alternately, according to what is called
the fortune of war; but which, like the fortune of the gaming-table,
must end in the ruin of both sides, for the sole profit of the grim
enemy. While the forces of Rome were being diminished nearly every
day, her enemies were multiplying; and that inextinguishable race,
the Samnites&mdash;the increase of whose population would present a most
startling series of returns&mdash;appeared to the number of upwards of
4000, who had been enlisted into the Roman navy. Their intention
was to set the city on fire, but their own leader threw cold water on it
before it was even lighted, by making himself an engine of communication
with the Roman Government.</p>

<p>In Sicily the Romans were continually in motion, but they took little
by their motion beyond a few small towns. At length they determined
on one grand naval effort, and they prepared 330 quinqueremes, which
were placed under the Consuls, L. Manlius and M. Atilius Regulus, who
were probably selected as the most likely to be able to command a fleet
because they had never tried. The Carthaginians went to meet them
with 350 quinqueremes, in which were&mdash;according to tradition&mdash;150,000
men; an instance of overcrowding which would have qualified
the commander, Hamilcar, for the captainship of a Thames steam-boat.
The collision between the two fleets was as destructive as might be
anticipated. Thirty ships of the Carthaginians went to the bottom; and,
considering their cargo, we can only wonder how they remained at the
top. The Romans lost comparatively little, for with them matters
went on pretty swimmingly. Regulus was so elated that he sailed for
Africa, and, having taken Clupea, the neighbourhood of which was
cultivated like a garden, he sat down to enjoy the fruits of success.
He took the pick of everything he could lay his hands upon, and he
pounced upon the cattle wherever a herd was to be seen. At the end
of the year his colleague, L. Manlius, returned to Rome, with a portion
of the fleet, and 27,000 prisoners&mdash;an arrangement that savours of an
enormous cram&mdash;and left Regulus alone in his glory, which was destined
to become his shame.</p>

<p>Early in the year of the city 498, Regulus, having the field to himself,
went into it with great confidence. He laid siege to the town of
Adis, which the Carthaginians tried to relieve; but getting among the
mountains with their elephants, they were unable to turn round, and
found themselves encumbered by the trunks as well as the bodies of
these ponderous animals. Regulus took Tunis, and several other places,
though in the course of the campaign he is said to have encountered an
unexpected enemy in the form of a snake in the grass&mdash;a species of
serpent one hundred and twenty feet long, which swallowed up his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
soldiers by hundreds&mdash;swords and all&mdash;though the reptile ran the risk
of cutting its own throat by such extreme voracity.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The Carthaginians were anxious for peace, and sent ambassadors to
the Roman camp to negotiate, but Regulus, in his proposal of terms,
exceeded all reasonable limits. He pretended to act on the principle
of give and take, but the giving was to be all on one side, and the taking
all on the other. The Carthaginians returned no answer to these insolent
demands; but it is probable their silence must soon have been
construed into consent, had it not been for the valour of a Spartan
of the name of Xanthippus. This individual was a mere mercenary,
who put other people to death for his own living; but he was, at
all events, a working man, and infused his own spirit of energy into the
Carthaginian army. He personally superintended the training, not
only of the men, but of the elephants, and taught the soldiers how
to wield as a power those hitherto unwieldy animals. Taking a hundred
under his immediate tuition, he brought them into such a state of
docility, that when turned out for exercise, they formed a stud worthy
of the zoologist's attentive study.</p>

<p>With these sagacious brutes, and a large number of troops, he went
forth against Regulus, whose army amounted to 30,000 men; but the
soldiers of Xanthippus fought with the courage of lions, which, backed
up as it was by the firmness of the elephants, gave them a decisive
victory. More than 30,000 Romans perished, if the accounts handed
down to us are to be believed, and 500 were taken prisoners, though, if
the same accounts are to be believed, the Roman army was only 30,000
strong; so that the 500 captives must have been supplied from some of
those exclusive sources which are open to none but the historian. 2000
more are alleged to have escaped, but we must leave the reader to solve
the difficulty as he can; for as two into one will not go, so 33,500 out
of 30,000 will not come by any process we are acquainted with.
Xanthippus, the mercenary, had made it worth his while, for he was
highly paid, and received rich presents, with which, as he dreaded the
envy of the nobles, he thought he had better make himself absent as
speedily as possible. He returned, therefore, to Sparta, to astonish the
natives of his own city with the wealth he had acquired.</p>

<p>The Consuls of the year, Ser. Fulvius and M. Aemilius, were now
despatched with the whole of the Roman fleet, amounting to about 300
ships, to Africa, where, after destroying the whole of the Carthaginian
fleet, it went ashore on the southern coast; and this fleet of 300 ships
lost, according to the authorities,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> 340 vessels. The Carthaginians,
whose army on land amounted to about 18,000, managed to lose about
30,000 at sea; but an abundant population was still left for the historian
to deal, or rather to cut and shuffle, with. We must confess
ourselves wholly incompetent to grapple with the arithmetical problems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
that continually present themselves to us in the course of our researches,
and we therefore postpone all attempt at a solution of the
difficulty until the universal solvent shall be discovered.</p>

<p>The Romans and Carthaginians, instead of being overwhelmed by
their own misfortunes, were in high spirits at the disasters of each other,
and both parties proceeded to repair the damage done to themselves, in
order to qualify them for doing further injury. At Rome the Senate
ordered a new fleet to be built, which took several Carthaginian towns,
and Carthage ordered a fresh army to be levied, which took nearly all
the Roman vessels.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards another naval force was despatched under the
Consuls, Cn. Serulius Cæpio and C. Sempronius Blaesus, who had got
together 260 ships, with which sundry ravages had been committed on
the African coast, when the sea, with its insatiable appetite, swallowed
up at a few gulps the greater part of the squadron.</p>

<p>Rome was now thoroughly sea-sick, and determined to have nothing
more to do with the water, but to wash her hands of it. She was,
however, still powerful by land, and encountered the Carthaginians at
Panormus, where the pro-consul, L. C. Metellus, gained a decisive
victory, by turning the elephants against their owners, and fighting the
latter as it were with their own weapons. This defeat led to a desire
on the part of Carthage for peace, and an embassy was sent to Rome,
accompanied by Regulus, who had been a prisoner five years, and who
agreed to consider himself morally in pawn, pledging himself to
return, if the terms proposed by Carthage should not be acceded to by
his countrymen. The conduct of Regulus seems to have been dictated
by a strong love of histrionic display, for he appears to have been
acting a part in which he sought to make as many effective points as
possible. In the first act we find him at the gates of Rome, refusing
to come in, although he had left Carthage for the purpose of doing so.
His wife and two children having gone to meet him, he looked at
them as strangers; but this piece of dramatic effect may be accounted
for as springing from various other motives than those affecting the
patriot.</p>

<p>Having been invited to take his seat in the Senate, he at first refused,
but he yielded after a considerable amount of pressing; a proof that his
refusal was founded on no fixed principle. When asked for his
opinion on the Carthaginian question, he spoke against the arrangement
he had been sent home to further, and the noble Romans strongly
urged him to stay behind, though he had pledged his honour to return,
and the Pontifex Maximus, the head of the religion of the nation, devised
a dodge by which Regulus might have evaded his promise. It must,
however, be stated, to his credit, that he kept his word to the Carthaginians,
and returned among them; but instead of being hailed as a hero,
he was denounced as an impostor, and put to death in the most cruel
manner. The stories told of his being corked up in a cask filled with
nails and serpents, are altogether false; for, after carefully looking into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the matter, we are glad to be enabled to knock the cask to pieces by the
gentlest tap possible.</p>

<p>Rome, having refused to make peace, was compelled, in self-defence,
to go to war, and ordered 200 new ships with the recklessness of the spend-thrift
who, calling on his coachmaker, desired that "some more gigs"
should be immediately sent home to him. The Carthaginian fleet was
in the harbour of Drepana, when P. Claudius Pulcher&mdash;son of Appius
the blind, and who seems to have wilfully shut his eyes to the danger
he ought to have seen&mdash;determined to surprise the enemy. Every
attempt to dissuade him from his rash purpose was vain, and he persevered
in spite of the auspices, which were declared to be unfavourable;
for the sacred chickens were completely off their feed&mdash;a fact he set at
defiance, by observing that, if the birds would not eat, he would at least
make them drink; and he threw them all neck and crop into the water.
The fate of the chickens went to the hearts of the Roman soldiers, who
became thoroughly chicken-hearted, and fought so languidly, that they
allowed themselves to fall by hundreds into the hands of the enemy.
The Senate recalled Claudius to Rome, where a charge of high treason
was preferred against him; but a thunder-storm interrupted the proceedings,
which were never resumed, for the thunder seems to have
cleared the air of all the clouds impending over him. As he must have
ultimately died in some way or other, and as there are no records
of his having been put to death, history has returned an open verdict,
which is equally adapted to the suspicion that he came to his death by
his own hands, or that it was brought to him by the hands of his fellow
countrymen.</p>

<p>The reverses of Rome by sea were a second time the cause of her
giving up her naval establishments, and she sold her marine equipments
to the dealers in marine stores, at a ruinous sacrifice. Carthage, therefore,
became mistress of the seas; but the mistress being unable to pay
the wages she owed, began borrowing money of her neighbours. Ptolemy
of Egypt was applied to, but he civilly laid his hand on his heart,
declaring he had nothing to lend, and kept his money&mdash;if he had any&mdash;in
his pocket. In this dilemma, the command of the Carthaginians
fell upon Hamilcar, surnamed Barca, or the lightning, from his being
one of the fastest men of the day; and though any general, equal
to the general run, might head a force with plenty of money to pay the
troops, a genius was required to keep an army going, or rather to keep
up a standing army, with empty pockets. He found the mercenaries
in a state of insubordination for want of their customary emolument;
but, having no money of his own, he made Bruttium and Locri his
bankers, and gave his soldiers a general authority to draw, with their
swords, for whatever they required. Taking his position on Mount
Hercte, now the Monte Pelegrino, he maintained himself and his army
for three years, enabling his troops to carry out the principle of spending
half-a-crown out of sixpence a day&mdash;the sixpence being their own, and
the half-crown being anybody else's, from whom it could be most conveniently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
taken. After remaining three years at Hercte, he removed to
the town of Eryx, intending to tire the Romans out; but like many
others who attempt to exhaust the patience of others, he found his own
stock rapidly diminishing. He was drawn into an engagement, in
which he lost so many of his soldiers, that he was obliged to ask for a
truce to bury the dead; but the Roman general would give him no undertaking
not to proceed during the funerals. A short time afterwards,
when the fortune of war had changed, Hamilcar was asked to give a
similar permission, and, by allowing the burials to proceed, he has raised
a monument to his own magnanimity.</p>

<p>The Romans, who were as fickle on the subject of a fleet as the
element to which it was destined, resolved a third time to have a
naval force; but ships were out of the question, when raising the wind
was quite impossible. The state being without funds, appealed to the
merchants, who consented to sink a large sum in an entirely new
navy, with the understanding that if the tide of fortune should turn in
their favour, they were to receive their money back again. The
Romans had by this time become better sailors than before, while the
Carthaginian tars had greatly deteriorated for want of practice. The
ships of the latter were so heavily laden with corn that they could not
proceed like chaff before the wind; and the sailors, encumbered by the
cargo, found themselves going continually against the grain in attempting
to work the vessels. The Romans obtained an easy victory, but it
could not have been so easy to dispose of its results; for, after killing
14,000 men, they found themselves still saddled with 34,000 prisoners.
A peace was concluded; one of the conditions being, that Carthage
should pay to Rome 200 talents by instalments extending over twenty
years&mdash;an arrangement equivalent to the discharge of a liability at the
rate of one shilling per annum in the pound, and the extinction of the
whole debt by simply paying the interest.</p>

<p>The first Punic War was now at an end, and it was high time it
should be, for the losses sustained on both sides were enough to have
exhausted the Roman as well as the Carthaginian population; and our
history would then have come to an abrupt termination, like the tragedy
of the youth, who was obliged to drop his curtain in the second act, in
consequence of his having killed all his characters. It is fortunate,
therefore, that the classical authorities, after "cutting to pieces" their
thousands and drowning their hundreds, in a day, should have paused
in their career of devastation just in time to leave something to go on
with, to the conscientious historian.</p>

<p>While, however, war killed everything else, it kept itself alive in the
most extraordinary manner; for though brought to a temporary pause
by having swallowed up all its usual articles of consumption, fresh food
was speedily found, and the jaws of destruction were again on active
service.</p>

<p>The Romans having subdued Sicily, proceeded to prepare a constitution,
or, in other words, having rendered the place subservient to
themselves, they took measures for supplying a livery. Being tired of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the old pattern, they devised something new, and produced an article
of the following fashion:&mdash;They made Sicily a province; but those
whose province it is to say what a province was, have left us in some
doubt as to its precise meaning. The best definition is that which
derives the word from Providentia, a duty, or a thing that ought to be
done, and the provinces of the Romans were sometimes done indeed,
though in a sense more modern and familiar than classical. A province,
instead of becoming a part of Rome, retained its national existence,
though such existence was scarcely worth having, for it was accompanied
by a loss of sovereignty,&mdash;a condition that may be compared to that of a
body living after its head was off.</p>

<p>A governor was sent annually from Rome with a long train of officials,
and the appointment being only for a year, leaves no doubt that the
holder for the time being made the most he could of it. His staff
included two Quæstors or tax-collectors, and a number of Præcones or
auctioneers, who were always ready to sell off, in the event of a seizure.
Sicily was, in fact, in a state of complete servitude to Rome, the only
anomaly in the relationship consisting in the fact that the master, or
rather the mistress, received the wages, instead of paying them. The
amount was fixed at one-tenth of the wine, the oil, the olives, and
other products of the soil; so that much of the fat of the land became
the perquisite of the mistress of Sicily. These tenths were called
<i>decimæ</i>, and so ruinous was their effect on the place whence they were
drawn, that the words decimation and destruction have become nearly
synonymous.</p>

<p>The constitution of Rome had remained much the same during the
period to which the present chapter refers, though the aristocracy of
birth was beginning to give way to the far more objectionable aristocracy
of money. Such was the influence of wealth, that the Quæstors or tax-collectors
became members of the Senate as vacancies occurred, and
the enormous riches of these persons proved how much of the public
money, of which they had the entire handling, stuck to their fingers.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br />CHAPTER THE SIXTEENTH.</h2>

<h3>SOME MISCELLANEOUS WARS OF ROME.<br /><br /></h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">

<p><span style="margin-left:-1.5em" class="smcap">rostrate</span> greatness always
offers an inviting
mark to upstart littleness;
and the story
of the Lion <i>couchant</i>
kicked by the Jackass
<i>rampant</i>, is as old,
at least, as the days
when Rome, exhausted
by her wars with
Carthage, was attacked
by the imbecile
inhabitants of the
feeble city of Falerii.</p>

<p>Had the Faliscans dashed their heads deliberately against a brick
wall, they could not more effectually have shown how few brains they
possessed; and, to carry out the figure of the Lion and the Ass, a
switch of the former's tail soon told the latter's story. A few days
sufficed to lay the Faliscans in the dust they had so foolishly kicked up,
and in the clouds of which we very rapidly lose sight of them.</p>

<p>The Carthaginians had been compelled to evacuate Sicily, and the
mercenaries were of course to be paid off in one way or the other. On
a former occasion, some of the hired soldiers who had demanded their
money were taken to a bank&mdash;which proved to be a sand-bank in the
sea&mdash;where, at the rising of the tide, they, instead of their claims, were
subjected to immediate liquidation.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The army from Sicily took, however,
a firmer stand, and proceeded to Carthage with a determination to do
business in the city. It contained, as they knew, the spices and
luxuries of India on which they loved to live; the purple of Tyre, which
taught them how to dye; and the ebony and ivory which proclaim in
black and white the wealth of Ethiopia. The persons who poured into
the place formed an assemblage less pleasing than picturesque, for the
group comprised all sorts&mdash;except the right sort&mdash;of characters.
Among the mass might be seen the almost naked Gaul, who was
outstripped in barbarity by some of the other tribes; the light cavalry
of dark Numidians, and men who had their arms in slings; for such
were the weapons of the Balearic slingers. The mercenaries, immediately
on their arrival in Carthage, proceeded to the Treasury, where they found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
nobody but Hanno, who in an appropriately hollow speech, announced the
emptiness of the public coffers. He regretted the necessity for appearing
before them in the character of an apologist; but while admitting how
much Carthage owed to the troops, he announced the impossibility of
paying them. The State, he said, was heavily taxed, and, he added, with a
feeble attempt to be facetious, that he must lay a small tax upon their
patience, by getting them to wait for their money. The speaker was
at once assailed with imprecations in ten different languages; but he
stood firm under the polyglot uproar. The cry of "Down with him!"
reached his ears in nearly a dozen different tongues; and when he tried
to remonstrate, through the medium of interpreters, the worst interpretation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
was put on all that was said, and a good understanding seemed
quite <a name="impossible" id="impossible"></a>impossible.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;">
<img src="images/i_p0162.png" width="440" height="500" alt="Hanno announcing to the Mercenaries the emptiness of the Public Coffers." title="" />
<span class="caption">Hanno announcing to the Mercenaries the emptiness of the Public Coffers.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />An attempt was then made to stop the mouths of the mercenaries
with food; and provisions were sent in abundance; but the only reply
was, an unprovisional demand for the money owing. At length the
pay had been got together, and was about to be distributed, when an
Italian slave, named Spendius, who had probably spent by anticipation
all he had to receive, advised his companions to decline the offer, on the
ground that if they refused what was due, their policy might obtain for
them a large additional bonus. The suggestion was popular with the
mercenaries, who held a meeting to discuss the point, and who, to save
the time of the meeting, overwhelmed with a shower of stones anybody
who rose to speak on either side. The resolution was soon carried;
but it was by the aid of what may be termed the casting votes of those
who sent up, in the impressive form of a plumper, the first missile they
could lay their hands upon. For three years these intestine disturbances
raged in Africa, and reduced it to the lowest point of exhaustion, till at
length the malady wore itself out, though Hamilcar Barca, by intercepting
the supplies of the rebels, assisted greatly in depriving treachery
of the food it lived upon.</p>

<p>The pecuniary panic of Carthage spread in nearly every direction,
and the mercenaries at Sardinia, affected by the tightness of money,
called upon the African colonists to pay with their lives the debt
they could not discharge with their pockets. While the Sardinians and
Carthaginians were reducing each other to a state of such weakness that
neither could make any further effort, Rome stepped in, and like the
lawyer between the exhausted litigants, carried off the whole of what
they had been fighting for. Sardinia became a Roman province;
when Carthage, whose bad faith has passed into a proverb, complained
bitterly of the treachery of Rome: for we find the story of the kettle
accused of blackness by the pot, is as old as the earliest pothooks
employed in the writing of history. Hamilcar, who was the patriotic
mouthpiece of the day, declared that he would raise his country; and
it must be admitted, to his honour, that he did not take the means
employed by self-styled patriots, who pretend to raise a country by
stirring it up from the lowest dregs, but he tried to elevate it by all the
honourable means in his power.</p>

<p>Rome had at this time her hands tolerably full, and found employment
for her arms in all directions; when, to add to her embarrassment,
the Cisalpine Gauls were set in a flame by one of the many irons
that she had in the fire. An Agrarian law, proposed by the tribune,
C. Flaminius&mdash;whose name savours of the firebrand&mdash;was the cause of
the outbreak. The measure enacted, that the land taken from the
Gauls should be distributed among the Romans; and accordingly some
settlers were sent out, who unsettled everything. The Cisalpines commenced
negotiations with their Transalpine allies; but though the negotiations
were carried a very long way, they eventually came to nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Rome was so occupied with foes, that she had scarcely time to turn
round; but when she did turn round, she discovered that some very
objectionable proceedings were being carried on behind her back by a
set of people called the Illyrians. These persons picked up a dishonest
living as pirates, and had plundered, among others, some Italian
merchants who supplied the Italian warehouses of Rome and its neighbourhood.
The Illyrians were ruled over by a woman, named Teuta,
who, when applied to for reparation, observed that she was sorry for
what had occurred, but that piracy was what her subjects got their living
by, and she did not see how she could interfere with the manners and
customs of her people. The Roman ambassadors answered, that the
custom of their country was to protect the injured; but on this occasion,
at least, the country failed in its Protectionist principles, for the
ambassadors were slain before they could get home again. When their
death was known at Rome, every exertion was made to afford them that
protection which came too late to be of any use, and a large army was
sent into the country of the Illyrians. The Roman arms were perfectly
successful, and Teuta was glad to obtain peace by promising to put
down piracy, and by actually putting down a very large sum of money
by way of tribute. Rome had done considerable service to the Isles of
Greece by checking the disreputable trade of piracy; and as the
Romans took evident pride in being noticed by the Greeks, the latter
paid the former for their military aid, by some of those civil attentions
which cost nothing. At Athens, as well as at Corinth, Roman embassies
were received; and though the ambassadors might be considered rather
too venerable for sport, they were allowed to take part in the Isthmian
Games, as well as in the Eleusinian Mysteries.</p>

<p>The Isthmian Games were the same as those at Olympia, of which
we furnish a brief outline for the information of those who feel an
interest in the sporting annals of antiquity.</p>

<p>During the first thirteen Olympiads, the only game was the foot-race,
of which the spectators and the competitors, but especially the latter, if
they selected it as their walk of life, must have been at last thoroughly
tired. Wrestling was next introduced under the name of &#960;&#8049;&#955;&#951;, or Lucta;
and though wrestlers have for centuries been endeavouring to throw
each other, they have not yet fallen to the ground, for they still maintain
a footing in the sports and pastimes of our own people. Next
came the Pentathlon, a sort of five-in-one, which comprised, in addition
to the foot-race and wrestling, the practice of leaping, in which much
vaulting ambition was displayed; and throwing of the discus, as
well as of the spear&mdash;an exercise that required the utmost pitch of
strength and dexterity. Subsequently boxing was introduced, under
the name of Pugilatus, and it seems to have resembled pretty
closely our own pugilistic encounters; for in ancient works of art
we find the boxers represented with faces whose indentures witness
their apprenticeship to the degrading trade they followed. The
physicians of the period are said to have recommended boxing as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
remedy for headache;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> but this application of the theory of counter
irritation is not adopted in modern practice. Another feature of the
Olympian and Isthmian Games was
the Pancratium, a contest calling
for all the powers of the combatant.
In this exercise biting
and scratching were allowed&mdash;a disgraceful
license which leaves us in
no doubt as to the classical source
whence the vulgar phrase of "going
at it tooth and nail" is derivable.
Horse and chariot races were also
introduced, as well as contests of
trumpeters, who dealt out blows
of the most harmless description
against each other.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Early Roman Gladiator and his Patron.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />Such were the games in which
the Roman visitors to Corinth were
allowed to take part; and we will
now proceed to confer on the reader
the privilege once peculiar to the
inhabitants of Athens, by initiating
him into the Eleusinian Mysteries. Their celebration lasted several
days, the first of which was occupied in getting together the mystæ, or
initiated, whose qualification consisted in their having sacrificed a sow&mdash;an
act less worthy of a priest than of a pork-butcher. On the second
day the mystæ went in solemn procession to the sea-coast, where they
took a bath, by way of wetting the public curiosity. On the third day
they went through the interesting ceremony of a fast, which, to the
looker-on, must have been a somewhat slow process. The fourth day
was devoted to the carrying about of a basket containing poppy seeds;
and this literally seedy procession was closed by a number of women,
each holding in her hand a mystic case, the contents of which were in
no case allowed to be visible. On the fifth day the mystæ went, with
lighted torches, to the temple of Demeter, at Eleusis, where they spent
the night; but the torches throw no light upon what they were looking
for. The sixth was the grandest day of all, and was employed in
carrying about a statue of the son of Demeter; in whose honour the
mysteries were held; because, when wandering about in search of her
daughter, she had supplied corn&mdash;though nobody can say how she
carried it about with her&mdash;to the inhabitants of Athens. During the
night of this important day the mystæ were taken, in the dark, to see
what nobody appears to have seen at all; and we are therefore spared
the trouble of describing it. On the seventh day the initiated returned
to Athens, and stopped on their way at a bridge over the Cephisus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
from which they indulged in jests at the passers-by; and the obscurity
of the jokes would, no doubt, if they had come down to us, have been
thoroughly in keeping with the mysteries they were intended to
celebrate.</p>

<p>Such were the games and mysteries to which the Romans were
admitted in Athens and Corinth, though they had, at about this time,
established among themselves a sport exceeding in ferocity the
scratchings and bitings of the Greek Pancratiastæ, or the ear-flattening
and nose breaking efforts of the Corinthian pugilists.</p>

<p>Until the Punic War commenced, the state had found money for the
public games at Rome; but war having exhausted the treasury, the expense
of amusing the people was thrown upon the Ædiles, who made the matter
a medium of corruption, for they vied with each other in their outlays,
in order to catch the votes of the people. The Ædile who had carried
on the most extravagant games was the most likely to get elected to
higher dignities; for popularity has ever been, and it is to be feared ever
will be, the prize of those who possess the art of dazzling, rather than
permanently enlightening the people. That their taste was degraded
by those who sought their suffrages, we learn from the fact, that at about
this time the sanguinary conflicts of the gladiators<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> were first added to
the amusements of the populace.</p>

<p>There seems to have existed in almost all ages and countries a morbid
appetite, similar to that which formerly gorged itself on the spectacle of
human beings "butchered to make a Roman holiday." When the
brute-tamer promises to thrust his head into the mouth of the lion, or
the "intrepid aëronaut" is about to risk the dashing to pieces which
some previous aëronauts have experienced, and from which others
have narrowly escaped, the crowds who flock to be present are actuated
by the same sanguinary thirst for brutal excitement which filled the
Roman amphitheatre when an encounter of gladiators was advertised.
The attraction was great enough on ordinary occasions, but an overflow
could always be secured by announcing an entertainment <i>sine missione</i>,
which implied that the lives of the conquered were not to be spared.
It is to be feared that many of those who have never been at Rome
are nevertheless prepared to do as Rome did on the occasions alluded
to; and if the certainty, instead of the mere chance, of a sacrifice of
human life were to be announced as an entertainment, the largest place
of amusement in the metropolis would, in all probability, be thronged,
though the ordinary charge for admission should be doubled.</p>

<p>The early Roman gladiators were either captives or malefactors, and
were fed on a particular kind of diet, as brutes in the present day are
fattened for the prize-show and the shambles. To give as much
variety as possible to the sport, the gladiators were divided into
different classes, and, with an excess of ferocity almost incredible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
measures were adopted to give a dash of mirth to the frightful
encounters. Some of the combatants, called Andabatæ, wore helmets
without any apertures for the eyes, so that "roars of laughter" might
be excited at an occasional display of blind fury. Others, called Retiarii,
carried nets to throw over the heads of their antagonists, and when
caught in these nets, their lives hung upon a thread; for, if the net
did not break, their defeat was unavoidable.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The foes of Rome were just about this time so numerous, that whichever
way she looked, she had in her eye the sword of an enemy. The
Boians, the Tauriscans, and the Insubrians, with a number of miscellaneous
tribes, entered into an alliance, and threatened to enter into
Rome itself, where a prophecy was current, that the Gauls and Greeks
would take the city. Having consulted the book of fate, the Romans
found instructions for burying alive in the forum two Gauls and two
Greeks; a proceeding which, but for its connection with the grave,
would border on the ludicrous. An army, under the Consul L. Æmilius
Papus, was sent to Ariminum; but the Gauls, ignoring the movement,
advanced within three days' march of Rome, and ultimately found
themselves between the army just mentioned and another army that
had been stationed in Etruria. Flight was their only resource; and
though the cavalry took to their horses' heels, and the infantry took to
their own, forty thousand are said to have fallen on the field; but
even imagination, which is accustomed to wander in very wide fields,
can scarcely find one sufficiently extensive for such an incident.</p>

<p>It would seem that population in those days partook of the nature of
corn; for however thoroughly a people might be cut down and thrashed
in one year, there was always an abundant supply for the sword of an
enemy to go to work upon in the year following. The Gauls were
accordingly to be found in full force within twelve months after their
having been destroyed, and the consul, C. Flaminius, killed them all
over again; but they still were numerous enough in body, and sufficiently
poor in spirit, to acknowledge the sovereignty of their conquerors.</p>

<p>While the attention of Rome had been divided among her numerous
foes, the remnant of the Carthaginians had been expanding with the
usual rapidity, and had extended to Spain, where, under Hamilcar
Barca, a Carthaginian empire was in the course of being established.
Hamilcar's policy towards the Spaniards was bold and rather original,
for he determined to win their affections by thoroughly beating them.
Every blow he aimed produced a favourable impression, and the
Spaniards were as ready as so many spaniels to lick the hands that
were continually smiting them.</p>

<p>The system of Hamilcar was followed after his death by his son-in-law,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Hasdrubal, who ruled in Spain for eight years, and who proved so
good a ruler, that matters were kept as straight as could be desired.
He was, however, assassinated at last by some culprit, who has eluded
the vigilance of the historical detectives, for not even Niebuhr, who
stands acknowledged as A 1, has been able to lay his finger on the
criminal.</p>

<p>Hasdrubal was succeeded by the son of Hamilcar Barca, a young
man, named Hannibal, whose precocity as a lad was exemplified by an
awful oath, which he took at nine years old, under the direction of his
father. Whether it was judicious of a parent to teach his son to swear,
is a question for the moralist; but whether a child of nine could have
understood the nature of an oath, is usually a question for a judge; and
any intelligent reader may safely act as a judge in the matter
alluded to.</p>

<p>The biographers of Hannibal have endeavoured to prove that he was
that precocious nuisance, an infant prodigy, because, at the age of nine,
he expressed a desire to accompany his father to the wars; though there
is scarcely an infant of those tender years who, if asked "whether he
would like to go with his papa," would not answer "yes," as a matter of
course, without having the slightest notion where he might be going to.
Young Hannibal is said to have learned the art of war in the camp, and
to have gone into arms before he could be considered fairly out of them.
Before leaving Carthage, his father administered to him a soldier's oath,
and the boy swore like a trooper that he would be Rome's <a name="implacable" id="implacable"></a>implacable
enemy.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Hannibal, whilst even yet a child, swears eternal hatred to the Romans.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />On succeeding to the command in Spain, he was twenty-six years old&mdash;a
proof that promotion had been very rapid in his case; and, although
merit may have had something to do with his rise, there can be little
doubt that he owed much to interest. Adopting the policy of his predecessor,
he attempted to engrave his name in the hearts of the
Spaniards by the agency of the sword; and he may be said to have
literally thrust himself upon them, though they were often bored to
death by his too pointed attentions. All the South of Spain was under
his thumb, with the exception of Saguntum, which had hitherto slipped
through his fingers. He proceeded, therefore, to take it immediately in
hand, when the Saguntines sent for assistance to Rome, whose Senate
resolved unanimously that Hannibal could not attack the place; but
when a copy of the resolution reached him, he had already begun
besieging the city. He sent word to the ambassadors who brought the
intelligence out, that they would display a sad want of intelligence if
they ventured to come too near to him; and, as he had no time to go to
them, they had better retire. Acting upon his suggestion, they repaired
to Carthage, where they demanded that Hannibal should be given up;
and there being some hesitation among the Carthaginian Senate,
Q. Fabius, one of the Roman ambassadors, made a fold in his toga as
if he had some mystery wrapped up in it. "Here," he exclaimed, "is
either peace or war, whichever you prefer;" to which the Senate, in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
spirit rather military than civil, replied, "Whichever you think proper."
Fabius, throwing back his toga, and assuming an imposing attitude,
exclaimed, "Then I offer you war;" when the Punic Senators, taking
up his last word, raised through the senate-house a shout of "War,"
which, vibrating through every pillar, was conveyed by every post, and
echo sent back an immediate answer.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 361px;">

<span class="caption">His Excellency Q. Fabius offering Peace or War to the Carthaginian Senate.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />This was a declaration of that Second Punic War, for which Hannibal
began to prepare when Saguntum, after having held out for eight
months, was starved into submission. Though rich in the precious
metals, and particularly in silver, the Saguntines experienced the bitter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
truth, that to be born with a silver spoon in one's mouth, is but an
empty gratification, after all, when the spoon has nothing in it. Hannibal
sacked the city, and converted into baggage all the loose silver he could
find, which he kept in hand for the purpose of glutting the avarice of
his troops, whose valour depended materially on other people's metal.</p>

<p>The battle of Saguntum was signalised by the introduction of a
weapon called the Falarica, which was in one respect a species of firearm,&mdash;for
its point was covered with flaming pitch and tow, that, when
pitched with effect, carried fire into the ranks of an enemy. It was,
perhaps, fortunate, that inventive ingenuity had not gone very far
among a people who seemed only disposed to throw away the little they
possessed of it, in the form of destructive missiles.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br />CHAPTER THE SEVENTEENTH.</h2>

<h3>THE SECOND PUNIC WAR.<br /><br /></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have now arrived at the great historical drama of the Second
Punic War, which some authorities have divided into five acts; the
principal part being undertaken by Hannibal, and the scenery being
laid in Italy, Spain, Sicily, and Africa. The first act opens with the
passage of Hannibal over the Alps, which forms one of the most remarkable
passages in the life of that renowned soldier. In the second act
we arrive at the taking of Capua; and in the third, we see Hannibal on
the look-out for reinforcements, which never arrive from his brother
Hasdrubal. The fourth act brings us to Italy, from which the
Carthaginian commander makes a forced exit; and for the last act
of all, the scene is changed to Africa, when the curtain and 20,000
Carthaginians fall together.</p>

<p>Hannibal having resolved on the part he was about to play, called
together those who were to act with him in the stirring scenes in which
he intended to figure. His company consisted of 90,000 foot, 12,000
horse, and an unrivalled stud of 37 elephants. With this troop he
crossed the Pyrenees, by means of slopes, which nature had kindly provided,
instead of platforms. The first incident of importance which
happened on the way, was a mutiny among those, who, when they
arrived at the foot of the mountain, protested against being brought to
such a pass; and Hannibal wisely sent the discontented back, that the
insubordination might go no further. Forty thousand foot retraced their
steps, and 3000 horse backed out, on the opportunity being offered
them. With the rest of his army, he reached the banks of the "arrowy
Rhone," which he found particularly arrowy when he made an effort to
cross; for he did so under a shower of darts from the Gauls, who thus
pointedly objected to his progress. The hostility manifested towards
the invaders was not simply on account of their appetite for conquest,
but their appetite for food was productive of a most inconvenient
scarcity. To provide every day for 60,000 soldiers was difficult enough,
but there was something awful in the idea of the daily dinner-party
being increased by 9000 hungry horses, and nearly 40 healthy
elephants. The passage of the Rhone was a matter of considerable
difficulty; for the horses stood plunging on the banks of the river,
instead of plunging boldly into it. The elephants were still less
tractable, and were, after much trouble, pushed or persuaded on to a
raft, covered with earth and bushes, to make it resemble dry land; but
it no sooner began to move, than the unwieldy animals felt themselves
and their confidence seriously shaken. This caused them to crowd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
together to the edge; and, while taking this one-sided view of their
position, they turned the matter over so completely, that they all
fell in with one another, and most of them came to the same conclusion.
Continuing his journey, Hannibal arrived at the bottom of
the Alps, and, coming to the foot of St. Bernard, he extracted from the
foot all the corn he could lay his hands upon. The weather was,
unfortunately, so severe that the cold nearly broke his army up into
shivers; while provisions were so scarce that at one time there seemed
to be no chance of anything to eat but ice, and though the air was
thoroughly gelid, it was impossible to live on it. Tradition tells us, that
when Hannibal came to this point of his journey he found two brothers
in the middle of a fight for a crown; but what was the country to
which the crown belonged, or whether the article was a mere bauble
that had been picked up in the road, or whether the crown was a sum
of money representing the stake for which the brothers fought, we have
no means of determining. The combatants, at all events, agreed
that Hannibal should arbitrate between them; when, adopting the
principle of "Age before honesty," he adjudged the article in dispute
to the elder of the litigants. The decision did not involve any
very remarkable acuteness on the part of the umpire, who seems simply
to have sided with the big brother against the little one. The successful
claimant was so delighted with the judgment delivered in his favour,
that he placed a large stock of clothes, for the army, at the disposal of
Hannibal. Some fearful misfits arose from this neglect of the wholesome
maxim, "Measures, not men," for there was not a man whose
measure could have been properly taken.</p>

<p>It was now time to undertake the ascent of the Alps, and to
commence operations on a scale so grand, that all former experience in
scaling a height, was little better than useless. Many of the soldiers
at the sight of the mountains, instead of rising with the occasion, sunk
with it into a fainting state; and others objected to venture into the
snow, on the ground that they did not understand the drift of it.
Hannibal represented the whole affair as a mere nothing; and added,
that the passage over the Alps was not such very up-hill work after all,
for that men, women, and even children, had often been quite up to the
work he now proposed to cut out for his army. "Soldiers!" he
exclaimed, "you have no choice, except between certain famine on one
side of the Alps, or fertile plains, which you may see plainly enough in
your mind's eye, on the other." Hannibal having made this brief
speech, was rewarded with loud cheers; the army followed him, and
proceeding to the passes, he found them lined with Gauls; but he tore
the lining out in the most merciless fashion.</p>

<p>On reaching the Valley of the Tarentaise, Hannibal was offered
guides, whom, however, he distrusted; and refusing, therefore, to be
led away by specious promises, he sent his baggage by way of experiment;
intending, when he heard of the safe arrival of his soldiers'
trunks, to despatch by the same route their entire body. When the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
elephants came within a stone's throw of the Gauls, the latter hurled
down rocks in vast masses on the affrighted beasts, and snowballed
them with the snow from the loftiest part of the mountains. The
assailants, however, completely missed their aim, for Hannibal threw
himself upon them, and succeeded in completely crushing them.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 361px;">
<img src="images/i_p0173.png" width="361" height="450" alt="Hannibal crossing the Alps." title="" />
<span class="caption">Hannibal crossing the Alps.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />It was a fine October morning when the Carthaginian general set out
to cross the Alps by the road over the Little St. Bernard, and after a nine
days' march, which was at that time a nine days' wonder, he reached
the top of the mountain. The fatigue endured by Hannibal and his
army cannot be described, and the toils of the journey were aggravated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
by the chance of their falling into the toils and snares of the enemy.
Little passed their lips in the shape of food, and very little passed their
lips in a contrary direction, for they were afraid to speak, lest their
words should disturb the impending avalanche. The way was rugged,
save where it was carpeted by the snow; but even where it was trodden
hard enough to serve as a sort of track or guide, they could scarcely
trust to it, for it gave them the slip every now and then in the most
unsatisfactory manner. On the tenth day they began their descent:
and they, perhaps, little thought at the moment that in quitting the top
of the Alps they were coming down to posterity. The two first days
slid away merrily enough over the ice and snow, but on the third they
arrived at a point where the ground had slipped out of its place, and
left to the enterprising travellers a far from eligible opening.</p>

<p>The shifting of the earth had, in fact, put them to the most perplexing
shifts, for the old road had perversely gone out of its way to baffle
the travellers, and lay at the distance of 1000 feet below them. As
Hannibal looked down upon the chasm, his spirits fell for a moment;
but he speedily rallied, and determined, rather than allow his army to
perish with cold, that he would make a way with them. Nature, however,
opposed him by means of a mass of rock; and as he and Nature
were at variance, he began to think how he could best split the difference.
How he made his way cannot be confidently stated, though several of
the learned,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> who have gone deeply into the subject, have come out of
it in opposite directions; and the authorities cannot be said to clash,
for they are as wide apart as possible. Tradition, who never fails to
take a trenchant way of getting through a difficulty, settles the point at
once, by attributing to vinegar the success of Hannibal's scheme; but
the vinegar must have been sharp indeed to have cut asunder the rocks
which barred the progress of the illustrious traveller.</p>

<p>It is difficult, also, to conceive how he could have carried with him
the liquid in sufficient abundance to enable him to accomplish the object
he had in view, and we are inclined to the belief that it was by continued
assiduity, rather than by a mere acid, that the wondrous task was
effected. A good-sized cruet full of vinegar would produce no impression
on a common pebble, and when we imagine how many hogsheads
after hogsheads must have been necessary to moisten the rocks
through which Hannibal passed, it can only be the sheerest pig-headedness
that would still obstinately adhere to the supposition we have
stated.</p>

<p>The passage of Hannibal over the Alps may be regarded literally as
one of the grandest passages in history. Though subsequent generals
have, in some degree, generalised the achievement, the special merit of
it belongs to the Carthaginian leader, whose superiority over his
followers consists in the fact that they did but find the way, while he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
might have claimed the credit of making it. The exploit of Napoleon
has been compared to that of Hannibal, though the former, after all,
did but follow what had been, for two thousand years, a beaten track;
the latter being the individual who beat originally a track for himself,
and thoroughly vanquished every obstacle.</p>

<p>At length, after having nearly lost himself in the Alps, Hannibal
found himself, at the end of a journey of fifteen days, in the plain
of Turin. On mustering his army, he discovered that considerable
reductions had taken place in it; for the foot, which had stood
at 50,000 when he crossed the Rhone, had now dwindled to less
than half the number. He had lost 3000 horse, and his stock of
elephants had materially diminished&mdash;the few that remained having
become so thin, that there was a striking falling off in the material
as well as the numbers of the body. So little had his visit been
expected, that the Romans were not prepared for it; and Scipio, who
ought to have been waiting at the foot of the Alps, did not arrive at
Pavia until Hannibal had had time to recruit himself after his late
fatigue. Here both armies met, and Scipio gave battle; but Hannibal's
cavalry gave it to him in a sense more familiar than satisfactory. In
the course of the engagement, the Roman general received a wound,
which wound him up to the highest pitch of rage; and he would have
exposed himself to certain death, if his son had not valiantly rushed
between him and the enemy.</p>

<p>The Romans now began to rate each other for having underrated the
strength of the foe; and Tib. Sempronius was recalled from Africa,
where he was wasting his time by wasting the coast in the most unprofitable
manner. Hannibal pitched his camp on the banks of the Trebia,
where, among the bushes, he found for his army a convenient ambush.
Sempronius had by this time joined Scipio, who was still a great invalid,
and being generally indisposed, was not at all disposed for battle.
Sempronius, on the other hand, thinking he should obtain all the glory
that was to be acquired, felt eager for the fight; and Hannibal, from the
other side of the river, assumed the most provoking attitude, in order to
tempt the Romans to come after him.</p>

<p>At length, some of the guards became so irritated, that they volunteered
into the cold-stream, and plunged into the icy river. There
happened to be at the moment a fall of snow, which was taken by the
wind into the faces of the soldiers, who, nevertheless, fought with
bravery, though in appearance they seemed to exhibit a mass of white
feathers. The Romans, though nearly frozen to death, were not only
cool and collected, but eagerly sought, in the hope of warming themselves,
the heat of the battle. They were, however, completely
beaten, and retired to Placentia, from which the Consuls, with much
self-complacency, sent to Rome an account of the battle, in which they
attributed to the wind the blow they had sustained, and, plausibly
suggesting the ice as the cause of their failure, they endeavoured to slip
out of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Hannibal determined to pass the winter as quietly as he could, but he
appears, according to the authorities,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> to have indulged in a little
masquerading, for the purpose of deceiving the Cisalpine Gauls, who
more than once conspired to kill him. He would frequently change his
dress; and he appears to have had a large assortment of wigs, in one or
other of which he was accustomed to disguise himself. Sometimes he
would appear in hair of the richest brown, and at other times it was of
the reddest dye; so that the people were puzzled to understand how the
same head could, on one day, appear covered with the luxuriant chestnut,
and on another day, disfigured with an untidy bunch of carrots. On
one occasion, when a conspiracy against him was ripe, he came to the
council with a limping gait, and thus saved himself from a much more
serious hobble.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Hannibal disguising himself.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />In the spring of the next year, the Consul, C. Flaminius, was sent to
Ariminum with an army, and Hannibal started for Etruria. This
expedition&mdash;if expedition is the proper term for an affair so extremely
slow&mdash;lasted three days and three nights; the soldiers proceeding
through marsh and morass, through thick and thin, to the end of their
journey. The Spaniards went first, who picked their way, followed by
the Gauls, who stuck in the mud, and were spurred on by the swords of
the Numidians, who followed. All the horses were knocked up, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Hannibal, to whom all the glory of the march has been given, endured
the least of the fatigue, for, while the common soldiers were wading
through the mud, their chief was elevated on the back of the only
surviving elephant.</p>

<p>The advantages of a high position were, in this instance, strikingly
exemplified, for if Hannibal had moved in the humbler walks on this
occasion, the probability is, that he could not have walked at all; but
that, sinking in the marshes, he would have gone down&mdash;in a swamp&mdash;to
posterity. He, himself, lost the use of one of his eyes, though,
indeed, he exhibited throughout this disastrous affair an unusual amount
of shortsightedness. After reaching Fæsulæ, now Fiesole, near
Florence, he made for Rome, and Flaminius made after him as far
as Cortona; but Hannibal, turning sharp round the corner of the Lake
Trasimenus; ran unperceived up the heights, getting round to the rear
of the Roman general, who thought the foe was still in front of him.
While Flaminius was pressing forward, Hannibal and his forces fell
upon him right and left, as well as behind, and a fog coming on at the
time added to the perplexity of the Consul, by preventing him from
seeing his danger. A fight in a fog is one of the most dismal pictures
that can be described, if, indeed, it can be called a picture at all, when
nothing can be seen, and the whole is a mere daub, caused by a fearful
brush between two conflicting armies. Such was the fury of the fight,
that it is said an earthquake, which happened at the time, was
unperceived by the combatants; and, indeed, so shocking was the
carnage, that a shock of nature might have sunk by its side into
comparative insignificance. 15,000 Romans were slain, and those who
are always ready to prophecy after an event, began to see clearly in
certain omens that had happened some time before, the cause of all
that had lately happened.</p>

<p>A shower of stones had fallen at Picenum, but it does not appear
whether those who told the story of the stones had a hand in throwing
them. In Gaul a wolf had swallowed the sword of a sentinel; and in
C&#339;re the answers of the oracle were suddenly written in smaller
characters&mdash;a proof only that the oracle had got from text into round-hand&mdash;the
ordinary result of improved penmanship.</p>

<p>The battle had undoubtedly been fearful in its results, for Flaminius
himself was slain; and 15,000 Romans having been cut to pieces, were
thrown into a brook, which still bears the name of Sanguinetta, from
its being turned into the colour of blood, though the statement is too
extravagant to have the colour of probability. The horrors of the war
were great enough without the aid of exaggeration, and though the
instances of suffering were no doubt great, we are inclined to doubt the
story, that the Numidians went without their allowance of wine, in
order to wash the feet of their horses; for, though the animals might
have been unable to do without their hock, they could surely have
dispensed with their Falernian.</p>

<p>On the news of Hannibal's victory reaching Rome, the prætor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
announced the distressing circumstance to a numerous meeting of the
people, who, in the absence of the Consul, took upon themselves to
appoint a dictator. Q. Fabius Maximus was chosen, and the mastership
of the horse was conferred on M. Minucius. Hannibal was
expected at Rome, but, like a wise general, he defeated general
expectation, and proceeded to Spoletum, a Roman colony, which he
hoped would have held out great advantages; but it held out with
great spirit against him. Wishing to avoid the inconvenience of a
siege, and of sitting down before the city with nothing but a marsh to
sit down upon, he marched into Picenum, which contained abundance
of everything necessary for the support of his army. His soldiers were
afflicted at this time with a cutaneous disease, and, though this
annoyance was only skin-deep, he feared a general breaking-out, if he
had detained them against their will in an unhealthy country. From
Picenum he passed into Apulia; and though he was disappointed in
the hope that the inhabitants would join him, they were too weak to
resist, and he turned every Italian city into an Italian warehouse for
the supply of the comestibles he required. The dictator Fabius
followed at a short distance, but always taking the high ground, by
hovering about the hills and keeping the upper hand of Hannibal.</p>

<p>His intention was to proceed to Casinum, but by some stupid misunderstanding,
the general led the way to Casilinum, and the result
was, that Fabius got ahead of him. On the mistake being discovered
by Hannibal, he got 2000 oxen&mdash;but where he got them from does not
exactly appear&mdash;and, having procured several thousand bundles of
wood, he tied them to the horns of the animals. Having set the wood
on fire, he turned the oxen out among the Romans, whose quarters
soon were thrown into the sort of confusion prevalent in a London
thoroughfare on a Smithfield market-day. In order to inflame the oxen,
their horns had been covered over with pitch, which gave them an
inclination to toss, and the poor creatures were running about in all
directions, under the influence of fear and fury. Fabius is said to have
mistaken the cattle for the Carthaginians, and to have rushed forwards,
sword in hand, resolved on butchery. The Romans were thus drawn
out of their favourable position, and Hannibal slipped into it, leaving
the bulls to decide by a toss-up, if they pleased, the chances of victory
over their aggressors. On the mistake being discovered by Fabius, he
backed out as well as he could, and ventured on a few skirmishes, in
which he met with some success, but he continued his policy of trying
to tire out the enemy.</p>

<p>The plan he adopted was to continue always in an imposing attitude
but to be ready to slip away, so that, when his antagonist gathered up
his strength to make a hit, the force was always expended on vacancy.
The Romans grew extremely impatient of a series of tactics which
showed no immediate result; and Fabius, having occasion to return to
Rome, was insulted by having the epithet of Cunctator, the dawdler,
or the slow-coach, applied to him. One of the tribunes even went so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
far as to charge him with treachery; to which he made, what is usually
called, the "noble" reply, "Fabius cannot be suspected."</p>

<p>It seems to have been extremely easy to get a reputation for "noble"
replies among the Romans, since the mere denial of a charge, amounting
to the commonplace plea of "not guilty," is frequently cited by the
historians as a noble reply, because an individual in a toga happens to
have uttered it. For the purpose of annoying Fabius, or the "slow
coach," the people conferred on Minucius, who, for the sake of distinction,
may be appropriately
termed the "fast man,"
an equal share of
power with the dictator
himself, and half the
command of the army.
On the return of Fabius
to the camp, Minucius
proposed that they should
command on alternate
days, a course that would
have been extremely inconvenient;
for if Minucius
had ordered the army to take a week's march, it is possible
that on the day ensuing, Fabius would have ordered the army back
again. The latter, therefore, proposed that each should take a separate
half; but an army, like a house, cannot be divided without weakness
being the inevitable consequence. The ill effects of the separation
were soon shown; for Minucius, who was hot and hasty, was soon
provoked by Hannibal to make an attack, and the Carthaginian general,
who had been accustomed to talk of the Romans hanging over
him like a cloud, declared that they had now come down upon him
in a weak and watery shower. Minucius and his army would certainly
have been absorbed, or, to use a more powerful figure, they would
have been effectually wiped out, but for the generous intervention
of Fabius. The latter saved the former from destruction, when
Minucius, who was no less mawkish than rash, followed up the allegory
of the rain by bursting into tears, and throwing himself on the neck, as
well as on the generosity, of Fabius. Minucius resigned the dictatorship
into the hands of his colleague, who leisurely wound up the campaign;
and having resigned his power, has to this day reigned supreme as the
example of the slow-and-sure principle in the theme of every schoolboy.<br /><br /></p>

<p><br /><br />Hannibal was now beginning to feel the effects of the policy of delay,
for he was getting out of heart, and was terribly out of pocket. The
harvest had been all gathered in before he could lay his hands upon it;
and he felt it would be idle to take the field, unless he could take the
corn that had grown in it. His army was clamorous for food; and
complaint is never so open-mouthed as when hunger is at the bottom of
it. The Romans began to think the time had arrived for a decisive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
blow, and had chosen as one of the Consuls of the year an individual
named C. T. Varro, whom Livy has described as an eloquent meat
salesman.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> He had been in the habit of going from door to door in the
service of his father, collecting orders for meat in the morning, and
taking it round in the afternoon; but he was determined that his voice
should be heard in something more impressive than a cry of "butcher,"
at the door-ways of the citizens. His first flights of eloquence were
in the market-place, where he interlarded his ordinary exclamations of
"Buy, buy," with sarcastic inquiries how long the people would consent
to be sold by those who professed to be their friends and rulers. By
degrees, he quitted the shambles for the platform, and he began attending
public meetings as a professional demagogue. Like those who pursue
patriotism as a trade, he accepted the first offer of a place that was
made to him; and he became in succession a quæstor, an ædile, and a
prætor. At length he was elevated to the consulship, or rather the
consulship was lowered to him; for though the name of Varro became
afterwards truly illustrious, we cannot allow to C. T. the title of
respectable. His colleague, as Consul, was L. Æmilius Paulus, a
patrician, who is said to have cherished a profound hatred of the people;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
but why he is said to have done anything of the sort&mdash;except it is in
slavish subjection to the old prejudice, according to which all the
patricians are supposed to hate all the people&mdash;we are at a loss to
discover. The two Consuls were at daggers drawn between themselves,
which prevented them from agreeing as to the proper time for drawing
the sword against the enemy. C. T. Varro, the ex-butcher, was for
cutting and slashing at the Carthaginians off-hand; but Æmilius Paulus,
having consulted a poulterer, declared the sacred chickens to have lost
their appetites, which some considered a foul pretext, and others a fair
excuse, for avoiding a battle. The Consuls had, however, set out with
80,000 foot, and 6000 horse, which were encamped on the river Aufidus;
their stores being packed up in baskets and cans at the little town of
Cannæ. Hannibal, who was completely out of elephants&mdash;there being
not even one left for the saddle for his own especial use&mdash;was compelled
to ride the high horse&mdash;the highest he could find among his cavalry&mdash;as
a substitute. He took Cannæ under the very eyes and Roman
noses of the consuls, one of whom, Varro, would have fought, but
Æmilius Paulus, the other, had taken the sacred chickens so much to
heart, that he had not courage for <a name="anything" id="anything"></a>anything.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Young Varro.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />At length, on the 2nd of August, Hannibal, whose pockets were
empty of cash, and whose baggage was bare of provisions, determined to
provoke the Romans to a battle. Had the policy of Fabius Cunctator,
"slow coach," been pursued at this stage, the defeat of the Carthaginians
was certain, for they were an army of mercenaries without pay, and in
ten days there would not have been a bone for the dogs of war to feed
upon. Hannibal, who had always much tact in discovering which way
the wind blew, was taking a walk in the morning, when his eyes getting
suddenly filled with dust, caused him to see a point that had hitherto
escaped him. It occurred to him at once that, by placing his army
with its back to the wind, the Romans who faced him would have to face
a blow which might prove very embarrassing. He knew that the dust
would set the Romans rubbing their eyes, or even if they did not raise
a hand against the inconvenience, they would, at all events, be compelled
to wink at it. In order to increase the annoyance, he ordered the ground
to be thoroughly well ploughed, and though he had not the advantage of
shot, he found the dust a very good substitute for powder. He had
placed the Gauls in the middle, supported by Africans on each side, and
the Romans having first attacked the centre, which gave way, were
enclosed between the two wings; a position in which they were so hard
pressed, that they could not get out of the claws of the enemy.</p>

<p>The slaughter was, as usual, tremendous, 45,000 being left dead on
the field, or rather, in conformity with the excess of caution used in
those days to prevent the return of an adversary to life, being "cut to
pieces." Æmilius Paulus, the patrician, who had been reluctant to
fight, was killed while boldly combating with his sword in his hand,
but Varro, the patriotic butcher, who had been all ardour and
enthusiasm to strike the decisive blow, ran off as fast as his horse's
heels could carry him. He reached Rome in safety, and such a perfect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
master was he of the demagogue's art, that he succeeded in obtaining the
thanks of the Senate for his services. It was true that he had shown
boldness, amounting to rashness, when the security of the army was at
stake, and he had exhibited caution amounting to cowardice, in taking
care of himself, by running away when the battle was lost; but he had
got the character of the "people's friend," and the people are often a
long time in finding out, and casting off, those who are in the habit of
duping them.</p>

<p>Among other instances of gross popular delusion which occurred about
this time, was the sending of Fabius Pictor as ambassador to Delphi, to
consult the Oracle. Fabius was the historian of his age, and was supposed,
therefore, qualified to record all sorts of falsehood; for history in
those early days had not been dignified by that conscientious accuracy
which is in our own time indispensable. His second name of Pictor
was acquired rather by his industry as a house-painter, than by his
talent as an artist, for he had done the whole of the painting of the
Temple of the Goddess of Health; and he probably devoted himself
rather to the pound-brush than the pencil. As a writer of history, there
was something of the painter in his labours; but he was unfortunately in
the habit of employing very false colours. On his return from Delphi,
the public seemed to have derived very little instruction from his
journey; for the sacrifice of two pairs of human beings, a male and
female Greek, and a male and female Gaul, was the principal result of
the information he brought home with him.</p>

<p>As it may be interesting to the student to be told how the Oracle
was worked in those days, we furnish a few particulars. The office for
making inquiries of the Delphic Oracle was in the Temple&mdash;dedicated to
Apollo&mdash;where a fire was continually burning, fed with the wood of
laurels, which typifies the ever-greenness that deception lives upon.
In the centre of the Temple was a small opening which emitted
intoxicating smoke, and, as the Pythia sat immediately above it, she
was rapidly reduced to a state in which she fell on the floor and
uttered incoherent sounds, which were said to be inspired. A prophet
was in attendance to write down the pith of what the Pythia was
supposed to say, and the purport of these drunken ravings was accepted
by nations and individuals as a guide to their conduct in cases of the
most serious interest.</p>

<p>Originally the Pythia was always a young girl, but, subsequently, a
law was passed, limiting the office to those who had passed their fiftieth
year; and there is no doubt that intoxication being the chief duty,
rendered the place peculiarly eligible to the old women. At first there
had been only one female employed, but when the business increased,
a second, and subsequently a third, was appointed, so that there might
always be one at hand to perform the duty, while the other was drunk
and incapable. Of course, a fee was exacted from all who came to consult
the Oracle, which was entirely in the hands of a few aristocratic families
of the place, who made a double profit, by taking money, and giving
only such advice as was calculated to promote their own class interests.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br />CHAPTER THE EIGHTEENTH.</h2>

<h3>CONCLUSION OF THE SECOND PUNIC WAR.<br /><br /></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Hannibal</span> was now strongly urged by one Maharbal, the commander
of the cavalry, to march against Rome, and the gallant general went so
far as to promise that if he had permission, he would go and take it
so easy, that in five days they might sleep in the Capitol. "The
idea is indeed a good one," said Hannibal, with an incredulous smile,
"but the only objection to its being carried out, is that it's utterly
impossible." Maharbal persevered in his recommendation; but finding
his advice rejected, he grew sententious and sentimental, which is often
the effect of a snubbing. "Alas!" he exclaimed, with that anti-colloquial
style of expression, which characters in history&mdash;but not in real life&mdash;are
so fond of assuming,&mdash;"Alas! thou knowest how to gain a victory,
but thou knowest not how thou oughtest to use thy victory when thou
hast gained it." If this was the ordinary mode in which Maharbal
expressed himself, it is not surprising that Hannibal preferred his
deeds to his words, the use of his sword to the abuse of his tongue, and
his hand in war to his advice in council.</p>

<p>The object of Hannibal had been to attach to himself the Italian
towns, but they naturally repudiated an attachment, which consisted in
his fastening himself on to them with an army which they were made to
support at a ruinous sacrifice. He had, however, succeeded in winning
over Capua to his designs, for it was inhabited by a contemptible race,
who lay continually in the lap of luxury, where the lapse of all the
better qualities would seem to be unavoidable. Not satisfied with
treachery to the parent state, the Capuans added cruelty to their other
vices, and stifled in their hot baths all the Romans who were living
among them&mdash;an enormity which sends the blood immediately to boiling
heat, to contemplate. The faithless inhabitants stipulated that they
should be allowed to break all their engagements with Rome, on entering
into new engagements with Carthage,&mdash;an arrangement like that of a
dishonest servant, who, having robbed a former master, stipulates for
impunity for past roguery as the condition of future fidelity. Hannibal
was weak or politic enough to enter into terms with this contemptible
set; but he incurred the unfailing penalty of wrong, for his own army
became corrupted by contact with the Capuan crew, and his fortunes
began to decline from the time of his alliance with this degraded
people.</p>

<p>The exertions of Rome to repair her reverses were extreme after the
battle of Cannæ; and though nearly every family had lost a relative,
the period of mourning was limited to thirty days, while a law was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
passed prohibiting all women from weeping in the streets, for they had
been found a crying evil. Sparing no expense, the state performed an
operation of a rather curious kind, for 8000 slaves were bought on credit&mdash;the
Government thus making a large purchase without any money at
all&mdash;and freeing these slaves, made them fight; thus retaining them
actually in bondage, while nominally giving them their liberty. Even
gladiators were allowed the valuable privilege of fighting the foe instead
of each other, and of falling in the field instead of falling in the circus.</p>

<p>Hannibal having used up nearly all his men and materials, was compelled
to send to Carthage for fresh supplies, when his old rival Hanno
exclaimed in the senate, that if the Carthaginian general had been
unsuccessful, he deserved no help, and if he had been victorious, he
could not possibly need any. The speech of Hanno on this occasion
would have done credit&mdash;or discredit&mdash;to a political partisan of the
present day; for it was essentially the language of a disappointed
leader of the opposition. "If," said the honourable&mdash;or dis-honourable&mdash;member
(for in mere party dissensions it is difficult to distinguish
one from the other), "if Hannibal has conquered all our enemies, why
does he send to us for soldiers? If he has reduced Italy&mdash;the most
fertile country in Europe&mdash;why does he ask us for corn? And if he
has obtained such rich booty, what on earth can he want with money?
The truth, I suspect, to be, that his victories are sham&mdash;his territorial
acquisitions sham&mdash;the riches (of which he has sent us specimens, in
the shape of a few rings,) sham,&mdash;while his necessities, and the burden
thrown upon us in supplying them, are the only things that are real."</p>

<p>This argument, though specious, did not altogether prevail, for the
senate decreed him four thousand Numidians and forty elephants, the
men and the brutes being looked upon as equally articles of consumption
in the game of war that had been so long playing. The Romans
began to act with increased determination, and blockaded Capua, which
was left to its fate by Hannibal, though an attempt to relieve it was
made by a detachment which received a severe beating at the hands of
Tib. S. Gracchus.</p>

<p>This period is rendered additionally remarkable by the siege of
Syracuse, which eventually fell into the hands of M. Claudius Marcellus,
whose efforts had long been thwarted by the genius of Archimedes.
This illustrious inventor lived to the good old age of seventy-five; but
how he lived so long is a matter of almost as much wonder as some of
his inventions, for his biographers tell us that he always forgot to eat
and drink; nor could he ever be persuaded to take a bath, except when
his friends pushed him into one. Even when this was accomplished,
he was sure to be found under the ashes of the fire-places, writing
problems among the cinders, and endeavouring to sift some important
point; so that a bath was really thrown away upon the great philosopher.
In a visit to Egypt, he became anxious to elevate the Nile
to a certain point; but he remained in Egypt until all his money was
spent, for the philosopher had never thought of raising the wind while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
intent on raising the water. He invented a screw, which still bears his
name; but he is said to have amused himself, during the siege of
Syracuse, by sitting at the window and inventing all sorts of missiles to
hurl at the ships of the enemy. One day he might be seen throwing
stones from a newly-invented sling, and a few days after he was found
casting out chains, to pull&mdash;with a tremendous hook&mdash;the ships of the
foe completely out of the water. He was so intent upon everything he
came near, that he gave a lift to enemies occasionally as well as to
friends, as in the instance just recorded, and he declared his ability to
give the whole world a lift if he could only find a convenient spot in the
neighbourhood for himself and his lever to rest upon. That in one
sense he carried out his boast, we are willing to admit; for he undoubtedly
elevated the world by raising the standard of science, and he exalted
the whole of civilised humanity by his great discoveries. The part he
took in the siege of Syracuse has been underrated by some, and
exaggerated by others; for though the story of his pulling the ships
out of the sea requires a length of rope, and other apparatus, which
none but the greatest stretch of imagination can supply, his destroying
the vessels by burning-glasses is perfectly credible. He is supposed to
have used very powerful reflectors, capable of taking effect within the
distance of bow-shot; and though for some time the moderns insisted
that the long-bow had been pulled for the purpose of increasing the
space, the powers of the burning-glass are now familiar to every
schoolboy.</p>

<p>On the fall of Syracuse, orders were given by Marcellus, the Roman
general, that the philosopher should be respected; but he was so
absorbed in a problem, that the soldier who was sent after him not
being able to solve the problem of who he was, or what he was about,
fell upon and slew him.</p>

<p>It is of the great man we have been noticing that a story is told,
which proves that the pursuit of the laws of gravity may sometimes be
associated with the ludicrous. King Hiero, of Syracuse, had handed
over a good lump of pure gold to a working jeweller to be converted
into a crown, with the distinct understanding that the true metal only
should be used, and that there might be no alloy to the pleasure his
Majesty would feel in wearing it. The goldsmith brought back an
article of the proper weight; but the king, after trying it on his head,
turning it over in his mind, and revolving it beneath his eyes in the
sun, declared his suspicion that the metal had been tampered with, and
a base imposition had been practised. He consulted Archimedes as to
the means of detecting the imposture; and on one of those days when
the friends of the philosopher had forced him to take a bath, he became
immersed as deeply in speculation as in the water.</p>

<p>The bath into which he plunged having been full to the brim, the
apartment was soon flooded by the water he displaced; and looking at
the wet floor, he thought only of the dry facts of science. It occurred
to him that any body of equal bulk would have done exactly the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
thing; and he immediately thought of his royal master's crown, which,
if all the gold sent for its construction had been fairly used up, should
displace as much water as a piece of pure metal equal in weight to that
which the crown ought to contain. The moment the idea struck him
he jumped out of the bath, and thinking of nothing but the bare facts,
he ran through the streets, perfectly unconscious of the naked truth of
his own condition. His shout was &#949;&#8021;&#961;&#951;&#954;&#945;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>&mdash;I have found it; but
everybody thought, when they saw him, that whatever he might have
found, he had certainly lost his senses.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_p0186.png" width="450" height="442" alt="Archimedes taking a Warm Bath." title="" />
<span class="caption">Archimedes taking a Warm Bath.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />There is, no doubt, much exaggeration in the absurd stories told of
Archimedes; but we may excuse a little oddness in a great man whom
none was even with. He ran so far in advance of his age, that eighteen
centuries had nearly elapsed before any one came up to him, and then
it was chiefly by following the track marked out by his footsteps.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
We must now leave the nobler instruments of science, to return to
the engines of war, which were as usual in full play, and had been
employed in the total dissolution of the already too dissolute city of
Capua. The dissipated nobles, palsied by their excesses, and paralysed
by their fears, fell by their own hands; for they had neither the courage
to fight for the chance of success, nor the nerve to meet the consequences
of failure.</p>

<p>It is stated that one Vibius Virrius, the chief of the Senate, on the
eve of the opening of the gates, gave a sort of legislative supper to
twenty-eight of the members, and, at the conclusion of a hearty meal,
he produced a cup, with the contents of which he proposed that every
one present should poison the remainder of his own existence. The
deadly potion was poured out into twenty-nine different vessels, and,
with faces more or less wry, the Senators swallowed the fatal mixture.
On the surrender of the place, the citizens were sold for slaves; and it
must be admitted that they had shown themselves fit for little better
than the fate assigned to them.</p>

<p>In the year previous to the fall of Capua, Hannibal had taken
Tarentum; but, three years later, the stupidity or treachery of the
general in charge, or man in possession, had allowed Q. Fabius
Maximus to take it back again. Hannibal was thus daily losing territory,
and his cause was consequently losing ground. Many small states
which had adhered to him because they believed him to be strong
enough to assist them, withdrew from him directly he appeared as if he
could not help himself.</p>

<p>Hasdrubal, the brother of Hannibal, had been harassed in Spain by
the two Scipios&mdash;Cn. C. and P.&mdash;when fortune cleared the stage for
him, by killing both within a month, and annihilating both their armies.
The fate of the two leaders had such an effect in Rome, that when those
eligible to command had heard the particulars, they had no inclination
to act as generals. Every one seemed to fear that if he went to head
the army in Spain, he should be simply going to his own funeral, and
every one naturally shrunk from such an undertaking. At length young
P. C. S. A. M.&mdash;or, to give his name at full length, Publius Cornelius
Scipio Africanus Major&mdash;who was only twenty-four years of age, though
he had entered the army at seventeen, and had been present, or rather
absent, at the battle of Cannæ, where the only survivors were those
who ran away&mdash;volunteered to supply the places of his deceased
relatives. An objection was, at first, made to his age&mdash;or rather to his
want of age&mdash;but, as there was no older candidate for the post of
honour and of danger, he was permitted to step into it. His popularity
was, in some measure, owing to his having acquired the character of a
serious young man; for ever since he had assumed the toga virilis&mdash;an
assumption something like the modern practice of going into stick-ups&mdash;he
had been in the habit of passing his mornings in the Temple of
Jupiter. He proceeded to Spain, with the title of Pro-consul, and an
army of about 11,000 men, at the head of whom he proceeded to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Carthagena; where he knew the enemy kept the greater portion of
their cash, their corn, and their captives. He was accompanied by his
friend Lælius, who commanded the fleet, and who was sent to make an
unexpected attack from the sea; for Scipio, who was very deep, had
ascertained that the water was very shallow. The defenders of New
Carthage had relied upon the ocean as a defence; but they had, in
reality, built their hopes on sand, which, during the prevalence of a
particular wind and tide, afforded easy access to the city. The place
speedily fell into his hands; and his gallantry&mdash;in a double sense&mdash;made
him with the brave and the fair an equal favourite. Towards the
ladies he was particularly amiable; and he not only sent back to her
lover an interesting young girl, but he returned to her husband a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
maudlin old woman. The latter was the aged wife of the chief
Mardonius, who weepingly implored that her sex might be treated with
respect; when the young soldier, hiding his face in his sleeve, either
cried or <a name="laughed_in_it" id="laughed_in_it"></a>laughed in it.<br /><br /></p>

<p><br /><br />Hasdrubal now turned his attention to Italy, while Scipio continued
his conquests in Spain, and, among other places, took Astapa, which, if
tradition tells the truth, he must have found without a single inhabitant.
It is said that the place was defended with such valour that only fifty
men remained alive, and these became impressed with the feeling that
when a thing must be done, it is better to do it oneself than to leave it
to be done by others. They came to the resolution that they were sure
not to be spared, and they had, therefore, better get rid of one another.
They accordingly proceeded to the sanguinary task of mutual destruction;
though, as one must have remained to the last, and there would have
been some difficulty in disposing of him, it is probable that he survived
for the purpose of acting as his own reporter of the dreadful incident.
The graver historians insist that not one was left alive in the city; that
the last fifty soldiers, having first killed all their women, and all their
children, made away with all of themselves; a state of things which
induces us to ask how the particulars have come down to us. If,
however, we were to indulge this spirit of inquiry to any extent, we
should, we fear, be compelled to throw a doubt upon many of those
interesting particulars which form the most agreeable portions of
history.</p>

<p>Hasdrubal resolved to make a grand effort, and assembled an army,
which including some Iberians, under his brother Mago, as well as
some Numidians, headed by Masinissa, their king, numbered 75,000
men, and six-and-thirty elephants. Scipio, though objecting to attack
a power more than twice his size, was compelled to do so, by a want
of provisions, for he had so little food that his army could not even have
grubbed on for a month or two. He was again victorious, and Hasdrubal
proceeded to join his brother Hannibal; but the letters written by the
former to apprise the latter of his coming, instead of going regularly
through all the military posts, fell, by some misdirection or indirection,
into the hands of the enemy. The Consul Livius Salinator went into
the neighbourhood of Sena Gallica&mdash;now Senigaglia&mdash;and was joined
by his colleague, C. Claudius Nero, who came, under cover of the night,
with a large army; and it would appear that the forces of Hasdrubal
kept such very early hours, that they had all gone to bed, and knew
nothing of the reinforcements that had been sent against them.
Hasdrubal, however, saw among the Romans, on the following morning,
some soldiers, whose faces were so sun-burnt, as to give a strange complexion
to a part of the troops, and he concluded that they had recently
been on a journey. After having indulged in an inquiring look, he commenced
a patient listen, and he fancied he heard two trumpet calls in
the hostile camp, when, without considering whether the second might
have been the mere echo of the first, he resolved, in his own mind, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the armies of the two Consuls had joined together. He accordingly
determined to fly, and began by trying to swim across the river Metaurus,
which is usually shallow enough; but the rains had swelled it to such a
torrent that he was soon plunged into the depths of misery. His guides,
following the impulse of their own cowardice, ran away as fast as they
could, and he, in perfect ignorance of the country, found the river rising
and his spirits sinking in about an equal ratio. The Romans came up
with him in time to find his army completely damped, and his troops
were, according to the military practice of the period, cut, at once, to
pieces.</p>

<p>Hasdrubal, who had lost heart early in the battle, seems ultimately to
have lost his head, for rushing into the midst of a cohort, he was decapitated
by a Roman soldier. It is said that the head of Hasdrubal was
afterwards brutally thrown into the camp of his brother Hannibal; but
happily for the credit of humanity, this story of the head is absurd on
the very face of it.</p>

<p>Spain was now subject to Rome; and Scipio, after quelling an
insurrection in his army, paid a visit to Syphax, who was king of a
portion of Numidia, and who was desperately in love with a young
lady, named Sophonisba, the daughter of Hasdrubal Gisco, a Carthaginian
general. Sophonisba was one of those troublesome persons,
known as fascinating creatures, who, by attracting the eyes of mankind,
set them very often by the ears, and lead to much calamity. This too
interesting individual had also won the admiration of Masinissa,
another king of another part of Numidia, when her father, irrespective
of any attachment she might have formed, gave her hand to Syphax,
by way of attaching the latter to his interests. Masinissa, in a fit of
jealousy, went over to Rome, leaving Syphax and Hasdrubal to fight it
out with Scipio.</p>

<p>The Africans and Carthaginians were, to a certain extent, people of
straw, which was the material they used in constructing their tents,
and Scipio, basely pretending that he desired to negotiate a peace,
sent a set of firebrands, under the garb of envoys, into the camp of the
enemy. These hypocritical incendiaries carried fire among the foe;
and, though the elephants fought like lions, the Carthaginians behaved
like lambs, for the poor creatures, thinking the burning of their tents
was accidental, looked on with simple bewilderment. 40,000 Africans
were cut to pieces on the spot; and Syphax, who had managed to
escape, was ready immediately with 30,000 more, to engage Scipio in
the neighbourhood of Utica. Syphax was urged on by his wife, who is
described as a woman of remarkable spirit&mdash;a character equivalent to
that of a very troublesome body. Poor Syphax did all he could against
a very superior force, but he was ultimately taken prisoner, and sent to
Scipio, while Sophonisba remained at home to receive Masinissa&mdash;like
a woman of spirit&mdash;at the gates of her husband's palace.</p>

<p>The lovely creature, admitting that she was vanquished, and declaring
that further opposition would be vain, appealed, in the character of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
unprotected female, to the generosity of Masinissa. Expressing the
utmost horror at being placed as a captive behind the car of Scipio, she
entreated the protection of her husband's conqueror; and Masinissa,
not knowing exactly what to do, politely offered to marry her. She at once
consented; and, after a widowhood of a few hours, she was presented to
Lælius, the Roman Consul, in her new character.</p>

<p>Syphax, not being dead, was of course rather painfully alive to the
conduct of his wife, and having hinted to Scipio that she might be the
cause of further mischief, an order was immediately sent to Masinissa
to send her back by the bearer. This her new husband was unwilling
to do, but he forwarded her a cup of poison, which she drank off with the
air of a tragedy queen, and died with a clap-trap in her mouth, which
was almost as nauseous as the stuff that she was called upon to swallow.</p>

<p>The Carthaginians now began to feel that every thing went wrong in
the absence of Hannibal, whom they invited home, and on his arrival
he was really anxious for peace and quietness. Scipio felt much the
same, and the two generals, having met, looked at each other for some
time in silent admiration. It may be doubted whether they got any
further than this point, for even if they had a few words, it did not
prevent them from ultimately coming to blows at the great and decisive
battle of Zama. Hannibal brought into the field 50,000 men, and
about 80 real elephants; but his soldiers were most of them raw, and
liable to be roasted on the ground of extreme awkwardness. He put
the Moors, the Gauls, and Libyans in front, the Carthaginian cowards
in the centre, for they were but a middling set, and he brought up the
rear, with a few of his best soldiers. Scipio exhibited some very skillful
generalship on this momentous occasion, and by a clever arrangement of
his forces, he left room for the elephants to run through the ranks
without coming into contact with any of his soldiers.</p>

<p>The success of Scipio was complete; and Hannibal returned to
Carthage after an absence of thirty-six years; having so far forgotten
the manners and customs of his country, that, during a debate in the
Senate, he dragged a noble&mdash;whose sentiments did not exactly coincide
with his own&mdash;by force from the tribune. On being called to order, he
explained that he had forgotten the forms of the house; and the discussion
proceeded as if nothing particular had happened. Carthage made
peace with Rome, on very advantageous terms to the latter; and Scipio,
who took the name of Africanus, enjoyed the honours of a triumph, at
which poor Syphax&mdash;who appears to have been everybody's victim&mdash;was
obliged to figure in fetters.</p>

<p>The terms imposed upon Carthage were very severe; for she was to
deliver up, without ransom, all the Roman prisoners: to surrender
nearly all her ships; and to part with all her elephants. She was also to
pay over a considerable sum in cash,&mdash;a stipulation which set the Senate
off into a roar of anguish, and caused Hannibal sneeringly to exclaim
that "the only thing to draw tears from their eyes was to draw money
from their pockets."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>
<p>Though Rome had been victorious, so fatal is war to all who engage
in it, that her successes had brought her almost to the verge of
ruin. Scenes of cruelty had dyed the country with blood, and left a
stain upon it which could not easily be effaced; and wherever the
sword of war had been brandished, nothing else had flourished. Troops
had been raised merely to be cut down; the country had been wasted
on all sides; and there had been a still more terrible waste of human
existence. While life was being made so cheap, the means of supporting
it were getting dearer every day; for provisions rose to an enormous
price under the influence of a system which converted the ploughshare
into the sword, and turned what should have been fields of corn into
fields of battle. To meet the expenses of the war, the public had been
obliged to run into debt; and there is no process to which the term
running is more properly applied, though the opposite movement is
always slow, and often impossible.</p>

<p>The Carthaginian fleet having been destroyed, Rome became
nominally mistress of the seas; but, for want of means, she made a
very bad mistress, and the sea might be said to maintain a mastery
over her.</p>

<p>War, however, had been in some degree productive of good; for it
had led to the recognition of the great principle that the public service
was not to be monopolised by the privileged few, inasmuch as where
there is real work to be done, there is scope for the talents and energies
to be met with among the many. Wealth, however, had become a
passport to public employment; and the door could be opened by a
golden key, which has, in modern times, served most appropriately as
the emblem of office.</p>

<p>The drain upon the resources of the nation was so considerable, in
consequence of the frequent wars, that the Senators sent their plate to
the treasury, and received bank bills instead,&mdash;an arrangement as
satisfactory as exchanging silver dishes for silver paper. The merchants
supplied dresses for the troops on the same terms, and accepted
printed rags for comfortable clothing.</p>

<p>Superstition also sensibly&mdash;or rather foolishly&mdash;increased during the
wars against Carthage; and the Sibylline books were consulted from
time to time, though usually with no other result than the recommendation
of a job, to be performed by Government Commissioners. On one
occasion the books were declared to require that Cybele should be
brought to Rome; and ambassadors were appointed, at a considerable
expense, to go to Phrygia, for the purpose of fetching her. They professed
to find her, and bring her home; but upon their arrival, they
produced nothing but a large black stone, which the people welcomed
as a most precious stone, and which they were contented to receive as
the goddess they required.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap" style="margin-left:-1em">ar</span> being still
the theme of
our history, we
are obliged to
ask the reader
to accompany
us into the
field, though
we are aware
that battles,
and their
deadly details,
cannot inspire
a very lively
interest.</p>

<p>Philip of
Macedonia
had become
jealous of the
power of
Rome, which
had now got a
footing in the
boot of Italy;
and, as Greece lay nearly under the heel, it was natural that the
Grecians should prepare to resist being trampled on. Philip, therefore,
concluded a treaty with Hannibal, and sent ambassadors with the
document; but, instead of delivering it into the hands for which it was
designed, they themselves fell into the hands of the Romans.</p>

<p>Rome at once despatched to Illyricum a fleet of 50 sail, when Philip,
observing that the vessels were being wafted over by a favourable
breeze, saw there was something in the wind, and resolved&mdash;whatever
the blow&mdash;to be prepared for it. This was the commencement of the
Macedonian War, which became extremely unpopular with the Romans;
for the people at large regarded it as a bitter cup, though the nobles
desired it for the sake of the "bubble reputation" that the few might
find in it. In vain did the tribes protest against the proposed war,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
declaring they were no enemies to Philip, for the Senate insisted he
was an enemy of theirs, and that it was accordingly their duty to fight
with him.</p>

<p>The campaign was opened by P. Sulpicius Galba, who crossed the
Adriatic, but did little, and was succeeded by Villius Tappulus, who
did nothing. Fortune had hitherto observed a sort of stiffness towards
both sides, leaning neither to the right nor to the left, when she
suddenly took a turn under the consulship of T. Quinctius Flaminius.
This individual was, comparatively, young in years, but superlatively
old in cunning; and he possessed in an eminent degree the low arts of
deceit which are usually held to constitute the high art of statesmanship.
He could electrotype falsehood with the external appearance of truth,
and he had no lack of that lacquer which brazens out a fraud with the
brass of impudence. Everything in the shape of rust had been rubbed
off his manners, which had become smooth in the extreme, and had
acquired that high state of polish which is frequently associated with
a very slippery character. He slid, as it were, into the confidence of all,
with the easy lubricity of the serpent, and with not a little of its
wiliness. His smile won, or rather lost, those whom he wished to
deceive, and he tried its fascination with such effect on some of the
Greek chiefs, that they permitted him to enter Thebes, and either did
not see what he had in his eye, or were induced to wink at it. He
pretended that he wished to parley with the authorities; but, when the
citizens were waiting to see what would take place, they found the
place itself quietly taken by Flaminius.</p>

<p>Thessaly now became the scene of war, and the Romans met the
Greeks near a line of small hills, called, from their shape, the Dogs'
Heads, or Cynocephalæ. Here both parties fought with a dogged
obstinacy, which was quite in character with the place, until the Greek
phalanx, or Macedonian heavies, gave way before the Roman legions.
The principle of the phalanx was to pack the soldiers so closely together
that their shields touched, and their spears being upwards of twenty
feet long, the arms of the rear ranks leaned on the shoulders of those
in advance, so that they went forth arm in arm, as it were, to meet the
enemy. The Romans, on the contrary, preserved a sort of open order,
in which there was room for the exercise of their limbs; while the
Greeks, if they were able to raise their arms at all, were very likely to
lift them against each other. If the Romans were in need of assistance,
there was space left in their ranks for reinforcements to come up. But,
amidst the density of a Greek phalanx, nothing could make its way
except a panic, which will always find room to run through an entire
army. Though presenting, by these means, a formidable front, their
line was no sooner broken than they offered a most unprotected rear to
an active foe, and the Greek files on the occasion in question bore
marks of a special endorsement at the hands of the Romans. Having
been packed as closely as cards, 8000 Macedonians fell upon the field,
or rather upon one another, and Philip fled to Tempe, as if he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
desirous to hide his face in its well-known vale after his discomfiture.
Here he negotiated an arrangement, which may be termed the peace of
the valley, though it was a kind of peace with which he could scarcely
be contented, for it stipulated that he should give up all his ships
except five; but he was, nevertheless, permitted to retain 500 men
of war in the shape of that number of heavy-armed <a name="soldiers" id="soldiers"></a>soldiers.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i_p0194c.png" width="550" height="358" alt="Flaminus restoring liberty to Greece at the Isthmian Games." title="" />
<span class="caption">Flaminus restoring liberty to Greece at the Isthmian Games.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />He was also to pay 1000 talents, which would have taken every
talent he possessed, and put him to his wit's end at once, if he had not
been allowed ten years, within which to find the money. He was
furthermore compelled to send his son Demetrius to Rome for his
education&mdash;a stipulation, of which the object is not particularly clear,
unless it was thought that while the offspring was being schooled, a
lesson was also being given to the father. Flaminius, laying aside the
character of the warrior, proceeded to Greece as a tourist; and, though
in private life he was as gentle as a lamb, he was everywhere received
as a lion. Having visited the Isthmian games, he interrupted the
herald who was about to open the proceedings with the usual proclamation,
and putting into the hands of the officer a scroll, desired
him to "read it out" before proceeding with the programme. The
document was an announcement of the freedom of the Greek cities over
which Macedonia had domineered; and the people, finding that
Flaminius had made them free, resolved on making him welcome.
Frantic with joy, they nearly deafened him with cheers, and almost
buried him in flowers; nor could he keep at bay those who pressed
forward to crown him with laurel. So dense was the throng, that he
must have felt a smothered satisfaction, if he felt any at all; and
even if he could have found words to return thanks, he could find
no breath to give them utterance.</p>

<p>In order that the Greeks might be shown the use of their new
freedom, Flaminius remained behind, to give an illustration of the
method of taking a liberty. Calling to his aid ten commissioners from
Rome, he proceeded to apportion the free cities of Greece in the manner
most agreeable to his own views; for it is a peculiarity of all freedom
imported from abroad, that it must be a freedom in conformity with the
taste of the importers, and not of those for whose use the article is
required. It thus frequently happens that what is recommended as a
luxury from abroad proves far from palatable to a people not accustomed
to the new commodity; and, though efforts may be made to force it
down their throats, at the point of the sword, the morsel is not easy of
digestion, and is only revolting to those whom it may have been intended
to satisfy.</p>

<p>After completing the independence of Greece, by forcing republics on
some of its cities, taking possession of some others, and establishing
internal discord in nearly all, Flaminius returned to Rome in the year
of the City 559, and enjoyed the honours of a triumph.</p>

<p>As no one is at times louder in his denunciations of dishonesty than the
practised rogue, so the Romans, who were for enslaving and plundering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
all the world, found it convenient, occasionally, to protest against the rapacity
of such as were rivals in the game of conquest. Philip had already
been dealt with on the principle that it is impossible for two of a trade to
agree; and a quarrel was now picked with Antiochus, who was doing a
somewhat extensive business as a wholesale appropriator of what did
not rightly belong to him. Flaminius, therefore, while declaring, after
his own fashion, the independence of Greece, stipulated that freedom
should be restored by Antiochus to all the Greek cities in Asia,&mdash;an
arrangement that would have left the cities at liberty to be made free
with by Rome in her usual manner. Antiochus justified his own wrong
by denying the right of any one else to interfere, and continued appropriating
to himself other places to which he had no legal or equitable title.
He seized on the Thracian Chersonesus, on the ground that one of his
ancestors had seized it once before,&mdash;a principle about as just as if the
grandson of a thief, who had been transported for stealing a watch,
should, on the strength of his ancestral crime, rob the owner anew of
the same property.</p>

<p>Finding Lysimachia deserted, he took it as his own desert; when the
Romans, growing jealous of his success in the predatory line, declared
that they should regard, as a direct opposition to Rome, any further acts
of plunder.</p>

<p>While matters were in this state, Hannibal was living in scarcely any
state at all, as an ordinary member of the Carthaginian Senate. He
had taken the opposition side of the house; and though he was a proposer
of many useful reforms, he was frequently coughed down, and in
a minority always. Finding little sympathy amongst his own countrymen,
who were all for peace and quietness, he entered into a negotiation
with Antiochus, for the purpose of ascertaining whether they could
arrange to create a joint disturbance, and thus weaken the Roman
power. Treachery was, however, going on in all directions; for, while
Hannibal was plotting with Antiochus against Rome, some of the
Carthaginians were plotting with Rome against Hannibal; and a
further breach of trust in some other quarter made him acquainted with
his danger. He accordingly resolved to escape; and having a small
tower&mdash;or marine residence&mdash;on the coast, he sent orders that a ship
should be ready to sail, and a berth secured for him. He walked about
the streets of Carthage all day, as if nothing had happened, and nothing
was likely to occur; for the Roman ambassadors were continually
dogging his footsteps; and he led them about so perseveringly all day,
that when the evening arrived they had scarcely a leg to stand upon.
Hannibal had, however, ordered his horse, which flew with him across
the country to the spot where the ship was in waiting; and, after
a difficult passage, by land as well as by sea, he arrived at the Court
of Antiochus.</p>

<p>True to his infantine oath, Hannibal did his utmost to excite hostility
against the Romans; and asked Antiochus to lend him a trifle, in the
shape of 10,000 men, as if they were so many counters, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
game of war required. Antiochus, however, like a boy jealous of his
toys, refused to hand over the 10,000 men, whose lives might be
required as playthings for himself; and he was not long in making use
of them.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">

<span class="caption">Hannibal leads the Ambassadors rather a fatiguing Walk round Carthage.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />The Greeks, being unable to appreciate the sort of independence
they had received at the hands of Rome, sent an invitation to Antiochus;
for it is the characteristic of slavery, as a moral disease, to seek relief
from the existing cause of oppression by the introduction of some
more violent form of the same malady.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>
<p>As the interference of strangers will usually lead to family quarrels,
so the effect of foreign influence on Greece was to keep the people
continually involved in disputes with each other. Part of the population
would have welcomed Antiochus warmly, while others received him
coldly; and the king, who had penetrated into Thessaly, had sufficient
penetration to see that he had better go a considerable part of the way
back again.</p>

<p>By way of narrowing the ground of dispute, he took his position in
the Pass of Thermopylæ, and had, for some time, maintained an advantage
over the Romans, when M. Porcius Cato, ascending the heights,
ran round to the rear, and, by a decisive blow on the enemy's back,
changed the whole face of the engagement. Antiochus fled in dismay,
and never stopped to look behind him, until he reached Asia Minor,
when he sat down, and took a gloomy retrospect of all that had
happened. While he met with reverses on land, he heard of the
reverse, or rather the same thing, that had happened to his fleet at sea;
and he fairly gave up, not only his cause, but the Chersonesus, Lysimachia,
Sestos, and Abydos, with all their contents and non-contents; the
latter of which included the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Antiochus, though subdued in spirit, was not quite beaten in form;
and a large army was sent to Asia, under the command of the two
consuls, L. Cornelius Scipio and C. Lælius. L. C. Scipio, though
without any acknowledged merit of his own, had the good fortune to be
the brother of the celebrated Scipio Africanus, who got him the place;
but it is manifest that such an illegitimate step to an appointment will
often end in a grievous disappointment of one kind or another. To
provide against the ill consequences of this flagrant job, the celebrated
Scipio went out in the capacity of legate, to counteract the consequences
of his brother's general incapacity in the capacity of general. The
Romans had 20,000 men, who, having arrived in Asia, met 70,000
soldiers of Antiochus, at Magnesia, where the latter received a dose
from which they never recovered. Peace was granted to them on very
humiliating terms; but, however bitter the cup prescribed for Antiochus,
so disagreeable was the recollection of Magnesia, that he was obliged to
swallow almost anything that came after it.</p>

<p>Rome continued her system of giving independence to various places
and people, many of whom seemed so little to appreciate the proffered
boon, that in some cases money was tendered and accepted as the price
of exemption from the proposed advantages. The Cappadocians were
so alarmed at the prospect of their new freedom, that, being still free
to confess their dislike to it, they sent 200 talents to the Romans, who,
no doubt, mentally impressed with the proverbial baseness of the "slave
who pays," quietly pocketed the money.</p>

<p>While the principles of independence were being promulgated in the
East, the Romans were also employed in carrying their notions of
emancipation into the North, where several tribes were cut to pieces, in
order that they might feel the interest which Rome condescended to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
take in them. In some places the old inhabitants were rooted up like
old trees, while the younger branches were transplanted to other soils;
and a large quantity of Ligurian offshoots were carried off from their
parent stems to fill some vacant ground at Samnium. Many places
were thoroughly destroyed; and among others, Cremona was so unmercifully
played upon, that it was utterly broken up, and the lamentations
of its inhabitants were regarded no more than the moanings of a set of
old fiddle-strings.</p>

<p>Not satisfied with being the masters of Italy and the tyrants of
Greece, the Romans aimed at establishing their dominion in Spain,
which was partly achieved by the treachery of some of the inhabitants,
and the cowardice of others. Some of its most powerful men entered
into an alliance with Rome, and were treated as insurgents or rebels,
when they dared to revolt against the foreign authority that had either
cowed or corrupted them.</p>

<p>The subjugation of Spain was mainly effected by M. Porcius Cato,
who took a rather remarkable way of reducing the country to submission;
for he induced several places to commit a sort of moral suicide; and
after condemning them in his own mind, he arranged that they should
become, as it were, their own executioners. He sent circulars to a
large number of fortified towns in Spain, with instructions that the
communications were not to be looked into before a certain day; and
the inhabitants of every town experienced the agony of suspense, in the
fear that their doom was sealed in a letter they were not allowed to open.
At length, when the day arrived for penetrating the envelope in which
the mystery was enclosed, every circular was found to contain a command
that the walls of the town to which it was addressed should be razed to
the ground, or, in case of disobedience, that the heaviest punishment
should light on its inhabitants. The authorities not being able to communicate
with each other, fancied their own town the only one that was
doomed, and proceeded to pull the place about their own ears, until it
was reduced to a heap of dry rubbish.</p>

<p>When the mischief was done, it was too late to discover that it need
not have been done at all; and though unity is in ordinary cases
strength, the unity with which the Spaniards had acted in demolishing
their own towns, had reduced them to a condition of utter feebleness.</p>

<p>For some time they lived in peace, though their homes were knocked
to pieces; but a war broke out again, in the year of the City 572
(<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 181). The Spaniards, however, were not thoroughly reduced until
four years after, though they were being continually killed, beaten, cut
to pieces, and otherwise dealt with, in a manner from which their reduction
would seem to flow as a natural consequence. It was Tib. Sempronius
Gracchus&mdash;the father of the two great Gracchi, of whom we shall
have something to say hereafter&mdash;that concluded peace with several of
the Spanish tribes, who were brought down so low, that their being
otherwise than peaceable was almost impossible.</p>

<p>The Romans continued to intrude themselves and their system on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
different parts of Europe, and planted a colony at Aquileia, in Istria,
which caused the Istrians to try and put a full stop to the disposition
which Rome had shown to colon-ise. A war ensued, which resulted in
the loss of three towns and one king, when the Istrians came to the
conclusion that they had had enough of it, and immediately submitted
to the Roman authority.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Hannibal requesting the Cretan Priests to become his Bankers.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />Having, for a time, lost sight of the illustrious Hannibal, we begin to
look about for him once more, and find him living in a Court, kept by
one Prusias, the greedy and needy king of Bithynia. After the treaty
made by Antiochus and the Romans, Hannibal had fled to Crete, where
he could not long remain; and, though history is silent as to the cause,
we may conjecture something from the fact, that he effected a clandestine
removal of all his wealth, though he pretended to leave behind him
a vast amount of treasure. Tradition states that, having procured a
number of earthen jars, he filled them with lead, and, strewing a little
gold, or loose silver, over the top, he carried them to the temple of
Diana, and requested the Cretan priests to become his bankers, for the
purpose of his entrusting to them this valuable deposit. The priests
assured him, with many protestations, that he would find it all right
on his return; and Hannibal, having previously packed all his real
gold into the hollow insides of some statues of brass, which he pretended
to carry with him, in his character of an admirer of the arts, got
clear off with all his money.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
He continued to travel from place to place, and had spent the contents
of nearly all his statues, except a small one, so that his means had
literally come down to the lowest figure. In this dilemma he found
himself at Bithynia, where Prusias gave him house-room for a short
time; taking advantage of the visit, to render his guest useful in a
war that was being carried on against Eumenes, king of Pergamus.
Hannibal, however, could not persuade the parsimonious Prusias to go
to the expense of conducting hostilities in an effective style; and,
indeed, there being no money to carry on the war, it was impossible to
do so with credit; for nobody would make any advance on the security
of a bad sovereign. The Romans regarding Hannibal as a dangerous
agitator, which he had indeed proved himself to be, required that he
should be given up; but Prusias, declining to be at the expense of
carriage, intimated that whoever wanted Hannibal had better come for
him. The Carthaginian general, foreseeing his fate, endeavoured to
make his escape by one of seven secret passages leading from his
house; but his enemies had found them out, and were therefore certain
of finding him at home; for they had taken care to bar his <a name="egress" id="egress"></a>egress.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Hannibal makes the usual neat and appropriate Speech previous to killing himself.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />Though possessing all the courage of a soldier, he was miserably
destitute of a superior kind of fortitude, and he always carried a
bottle of poison about with him. Finding escape impossible, he drew
the fatal phial from his pocket, and, as he shook it up, he indulged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
one of those speeches which are usually attributed by classical historians
to men on the point of suicide. "I will," he said&mdash;or is said to have
said, for nobody could have heard him, as he was quite alone, and nobody
could have been listening, or the bottle would have been snatched out of
his hand; "I will deliver the Romans from the dread which has so
long tormented them, since they think it too long to wait for the decease
of a worn-out old man." Here he may be supposed to have paused;
and, after giving the bottle another final shake, to have continued as
follows: "Flaminius's victory over a foe, unarmed and betrayed, will
not redound much to his honour;" and, with a mental once, twice,
thrice, and away, the wretched Hannibal may be imagined to have
raised the nauseous draught to his lips, and to have tossed it off with
desperate energy.</p>

<p>Hannibal had certainly, in his lifetime, shown proofs of greatness,
though, in the manner of his death, he gave evidence of lamentable
littleness. On the admirable principle of "look to the end," we are
unable to agree with those classical enthusiasts who regard Hannibal
as one of the most illustrious of mankind, because he was more daring
and more skilful in the art of exterminating his fellow-creatures than
many of his competitors. His personal ambition brought misery on his
own, as well as other countries, and his obstinate hatred to Rome was
not justified by his juvenile oath, for the taking of which he deserved
rather the birch than the laurel. The first public act of his life was
to swear when he was too young to have known what he was about,
and the last act was to poison himself at the age of sixty-two, when he was
quite old enough to have known better. He made a bad beginning, but
a worse ending, and he proved that, though aspiring to rule over others,
he was unable to command himself, and was in nearly every respect a
melancholy specimen of ill-regulated humanity.</p>

<p>Within about a year of Hannibal's death, Scipio Africanus also died
in exile. This great man, as it has been customary to call him, because
he was a large destroyer of the human race, was taken up before the
Senate on a charge of embezzlement. The case happened to be
appointed for hearing on the anniversary of some battle he had won,
when he declared the day was ill-suited for litigation, and the people,
who are always ready for an excuse for a holiday, immediately agreed
with him. His brother Lucius was involved in the same accusation,
which he met by producing his accounts; but, the popular idol seizing
the books, declared it was shabby for a nation to be too particular with
those who had served it so well, and tore up the whole of the financial
statement. Lucius Scipio remained in Rome; but Africanus ran away to
a villa in Campania, leaving his brother to undergo the confiscation of the
whole of his property. The innocence of Lucius was subsequently established,
and, though no "money returned," is generally the motto of the
law, he succeeded in getting back a part of what he had been unjustly
deprived of. He, however, having lived without his income, had no
sooner got the means restored to him of living within it, than he died,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
with the melancholy satisfaction of having had justice done when it was
too late to be of the smallest earthly use to him.</p>

<p>The merits and demerits of Scipio Africanus have been differently
estimated by different authorities; and though it is charitable to give to
any man the benefit of a doubt, no one would be thankful for the
admission that his was a doubtful character. Scipio Africanus was a
great patron of letters; but he seems to have been a despiser of figures,
if the story relating to his contempt for the accuracy of his accounts is
to be relied upon. Cicero has spoken eloquently of the simple habits of
Scipio Africanus, in his marine retirement, throwing stones into the
sea, and skimming with them the surface of the water; but this innocent
pastime does not relieve him from the accusation of making "ducks
and drakes" of the public money, which was the charge that Cato
had endeavoured to bring home to him.</p>

<p>He is said to have been generous to his relatives; but to help them,
after freely helping himself, may have been nothing more than nepotism,
under the disguise of a domestic virtue. It is stated that he
showed his disregard for wealth by relinquishing to his brother his own
share of his patrimony; but there is little merit in his having despised
the comparatively mean contents of his family purse, if he was unscrupulous
during the time that he had the public pocket to dip into.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap" style="margin-left:-1em">t</span> is customary with the grandiloquent to declare that
the page of history is stained with gore; but we limit
ourselves to ink, which perhaps, after all, furnishes a
decent type of mourning over the deeds we are compelled
to chronicle. It is true that history has too
often wars for her principal facts, and the numbers of
dead for her figures; but she is apt to speak rather
figuratively in estimating the thousands upon thousands
who are said to have fallen, sword in hand, or to have
been terribly put to it.</p>

<p>The weapon of war cuts, however, both ways; and
a nation cannot play with edged tools more safely than
an individual can indulge in such dangerous pastime.</p>

<p>The state of war in which Rome habitually lived,
had encouraged the worst passions of the people; and
nearly every vice had taken an iron hold of them. By
continually fighting, they had become familiar with
murder and violence, while the practice of plunder
had accustomed them to robbery. Military stratagem&mdash;which
was the very essence of strategy&mdash;had taught
them to regard cunning as a virtue; and he was a hero, in their
opinion, who would face the swords and spears of a foe, but sought in
poison a cowardly refuge from the "slings and arrows" of his own
conscience. The wealth taken by force was often appropriated by
fraud; and a successful leader thought nothing of putting into his
own pocket an enormous sum, declaring that it was unreasonable to
expect a general to be particular.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The few became enormously rich,
while the many were miserably poor. The higher orders grasped
everything, leaving nothing to those beneath, and the consequence was
a state of top-heaviness, which, when existing in the social column,
exposes base and capital&mdash;but especially the latter&mdash;to extreme danger.
Money had been acquired by some, who did not know its use; and its
abuse was the inevitable result; for the improper employment of gold
leads to every kind of guilt on the part of those who are possessed of it.</p>

<p>With the wealth of other nations, foreign fashions were imported,
and Roman simplicity was superseded by the art and cunning of the
Grecian craftsmen. The pleasures of the table were carried to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
gluttonous excess; and a slave who, in the capacity of a cook, could set
before his master an agreeable kind of sauce, was often allowed impunity
for insolence.</p>

<p>Extravagance began to prevail to such an extent among the Roman
women, that those females whose wardrobe was of a gaudy hue, were
virtually condemned to dye, for a law was passed by the tribune Appius,
prohibiting them from wearing dresses of a gay colour. The same
law limited them to half-an-ounce of gold; but this was unnecessary;
for the extravagantly-disposed would spend all they had; and they
were further restricted from riding at or near Rome, or any other city,
in a carriage drawn by two horses; for it was considered that with one
the road to ruin could be quite rapidly enough travelled. This law occasioned
some violent agitation among the Roman women, who manifested
the force of female influence so effectually, that in a few years the law
was repealed.<br /><br /></p>

<p><br /><br />The stern necessities of historical truth compel us to attribute to
what is termed the gentler sex, the introduction, among the Romans,
of some vices so foul, as to be at variance with all our notions of the
fair. One of the worst of these enormities was the celebration of the
Bacchanalia, introduced from Etruria; and recent discoveries<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> in that
locality have initiated us into the secret of what are usually termed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Bacchic mysteries. The mystification of the votaries was accomplished
by drink; under the influence of which they wound up their festivities
with a reel, such as may be traced in ancient paintings; and round
every such reel there is twined some important thread of history.</p>

<p>Imitation is seldom respectable in any case; for even merit loses
half its value when it is not original; but nothing can be more contemptible
than a people putting on bad habits at second-hand. Such,
however, was the practice of the Romans, who borrowed nearly all
their iniquities from Athens or other cities, and who wilfully brought
upon themselves the moral stain of Greece. Cruelty, which goes hand
in hand with depravity, had reached such an infamous excess, that it
was practised openly by those whom the people delighted to honour.
Among other instances, may be cited the example of the Consul
L. Quinctius Flaminius, who, while encamped in Gaul, happened to be
feasting with one of his degraded creatures, when the latter lamented
he had never seen a gladiator killed. A noble Boian entering at the
moment, to ask for shelter, Flaminius observed that, though unable to
treat his friend to the sight of a dying gladiator, he might satisfy his
appetite for cruelty by the exhibition of a dying Gaul. The "creature"
had no sooner expressed his readiness to accept the lighter relish as a
substitute for the more substantial meal, than Flaminius, drawing his
sword, smote the unfortunate Boian on the head, and ran him through
the body. So brutalised had the people become by continual war, that
no notice was taken of this occurrence until eight years afterwards, when
Cato, the Censor, brought up the charge, with a variety of others, more
or less weighty, against Flaminius, and caused his expulsion from the
Senate.</p>

<p>The name of Cato the Censor, naturally induces a few observations
on the character of this ancient specimen of the</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left:6em">"Fine old Roman gentleman all of the olden time."</span><br />
</p>

<p>He was the son of a respectable Sabine farmer, and passed his earliest
years in the country, where he followed the plough&mdash;a peaceful pursuit,
which imprints no early furrows on the forehead, but leaves many on
the earth it at once improves and lacerates. At seventeen, every Roman
became, of necessity, a soldier; and though in the game of life fortune
had dealt him a spade, he was obliged to throw it out of his hand.
Such was the lot of young Marcus Porcius Priscus; for that was in
reality his name, though he afterwards had the title of Cato, or the
"knowing one," bestowed on him. His military duties were performed
with credit, though he preferred cultivating any other seeds than the
seeds of dissension; and he was more at home in a trench dug for
celery, than in one designed for undermining a fort.</p>

<p>After returning from the wars, he took some ground adjoining that
which had been occupied by Dentatus; and regarding that individual
as a model farmer, Cato tried to make his own a model farm. So
thoroughly did he throw himself into his agrarian occupation, that he
may be said to have buried himself in his land. He wrote a work on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Agriculture,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> which included much miscellaneous information, from
the mode of buying an estate to the art of making a cheesecake, the
curing of a side of bacon, and the setting of a dislocated bone. While
attending to his own business, he found leisure to attend to that of his
neighbours; and in all their petty disputes before the local tribunals, he
was in the habit of attending the hearing of summonses for and against
his friends. He had a word of advice or a maxim to meet every
circumstance in which his advice was asked or offered; and he could
always cut through a difficulty with one of his wise saws. Some might
be disposed to term him a busybody and a meddler; but at all events
a young patrician, named Valerius Flaccus, considered him to be a
meddler well worth transplanting, and persuaded him to go to Rome,
"as," in the language of Plutarch, "a plant that deserved a better soil."
Here he "put up" for various places in the public service, and we
find him climbing successively to several very high posts, where the
example he set by his externally virtuous mode of living, formed a
decent contrast to the undisguised vices of the age.</p>

<p>Such was Cato in his earlier years; but the melancholy fact must be
stated, that, though flattery paints only one side of every picture, there
is none to which truth may not be called upon to add a reverse. In his
youthful days Cato had worked with his labourers; had partaken of the
same fare with them at the same board, and drank nothing stronger
than water; but, in after-life, he contracted a disreputable marriage,
and, giving himself up to the dissipations of the table, might have
found himself occasionally under it. So thoroughly utilitarian was he
in his political philosophy, that he looked upon a labourer as a mere
machine, which, when worn out, he contended ought to be got rid of as
speedily as possible. Cato the Censor owes much of his reputation for
morality to the fact of his having set himself up as a professional
moralist. Though he was useful as a castigator of the vices of his age,
there was nothing very amiable in the rancorous and uncharitable spirit
in which he performed his office. He had a keen appetite for an abuse
or a piece of scandal, but, while crime or error excited his hatred, virtue
and generosity seemed to rouse less of his admiration than his jealousy.
If he had lived in modern times, he would, probably, have been a
common informer, a rigid observer of all the outward appearances of
virtue, and a discounter of bills; for it is said of Cato, that he advanced
money at exorbitant interest to those whose necessities or recklessness
induced them to comply with his terms.</p>

<p>Religion had, at about this period, sunk to a very low ebb in the
hands of a crafty priesthood, who used the influence of their position
for their own temporal purposes. Prodigies were declared to have
happened; such as the talking of a cow, which was alleged to have
"whispered low" in a priest's ear; statues were said to have wept; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the tale was listened to by those who believed that their augurs could,
if they pleased, get blood out of a stone.</p>

<p>In literature, though it is customary to speak of Roman characters as
an original form of letters, Rome had nothing new, but trusted to what
was already known; for she not only copied the vices of the Greeks,
but took a leaf out of their books in a more literal manner. She had
no writers of her own; but what literary food she possessed was
supplied by those translating cooks who make a hash of nearly everything
they lay their hands upon.</p>

<p>The earliest Roman dramatist is supposed to have been one Lucius
Andronicus, who had formerly been a slave, and who continued his
slavish propensities by a servile adaptation of Greek plays, instead of
boldly attempting an original production. Like many of the modern
translators, he was himself an actor in his own pieces; and it is
declared by Livy the historian, that he lost his voice by the frequency
with which he was encored by the audience. This statement seems to
show that puffs were not unknown when the Roman drama was in its
very earliest stage; for the assertion in question could scarcely have
been true, since Cicero<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> has told us that there was nothing worthy of
being read or listened to twice, in the plays of Lucius Andronicus.</p>

<p>The greatest comic writer of the period at which our history has
arrived, was Marcus Accius Plautus, of whose origin little is known;
for the Romans held their wits and humorists in such little respect,
that as long as they could raise a laugh, it mattered little who they
were, whence they sprung, or what became of them. It was not until
after a writer's death that any interest was felt in his life, and such was
the case with regard to Plautus, who has been the subject of more
invention than is to be found in all his comedies. Conjecture&mdash;the
author of half the history, and three-fourths of the biography, which the
world possesses&mdash;describes Plautus as a low-born fellow, made of the
very commonest clay, moulded by one of Nature's awkwardest journeymen
into a misshapen lump, and whose angular deformities constituted
his chief points of humour. Having made a little money as a dramatist,
he is said to have embarked it in the baking business; some would say
that he might make his own puffs; but his shop failed, and as the
public would not, he of course could not, get his bread at it. He next
entered the service of a miller and master baker, where he attempted,
in grinding corn, to turn at once the handle of a mill and an honest
penny. Even in the bakehouse he was unable to forget the flowery
path of literature; and while watching the bread, he managed to
inscribe on different rolls no less than three comedies. Of these he
made sufficient to enable him to quit the oven, which was incapable of
warming his imagination; and taking lodgings in Rome, he resumed
the life of a dramatist.</p>

<p>What Plautus may have wanted in originality, he made up for by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
industry, there being still extant twenty of his plays, and he was,
according to some, the author of one hundred pieces.</p>

<p>The mantle of Plautus&mdash;supposing the dramatist to have died with a
coat to his back&mdash;may be said to have fallen on Terentius Afer, or
Terence. He is believed to have been born at Carthage, and to have
been the slave of a Roman senator; for his biographers&mdash;who, by
the way, were writers themselves&mdash;will not hazard the supposition
that one of their own order could have been the son of a gentleman.
Terentius, however, got into what is usually termed the best society,
which had the usual effect of the "best society" on a literary man; for
it took what it could never compensate him for&mdash;his time; it led him
into idle and extravagant habits, and thus brought him, where it
will inevitably leave him, if it once gets him there&mdash;to ruin. His
fashionable friends carried their patronage so far, as to tax his reputation
as well as his means, and even claimed a share in the credit of his
writings, declaring the best part of them to be their own, though they
suffered Terentius to affix his name to them.</p>

<p>Scipio Africanus, who stands convicted of fraud and embezzlement in
a former chapter,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> had the effrontery to say, or allow it to be said, that
he had written portions of the plays in question, or, at least, contributed
some of the jokes; but we have nothing to support the claim, except
the fact that he might, perhaps, have made a pun, as he is known to
have picked the public pocket. The following anecdote, related by his
biographer, Donatus, or Suetonius&mdash;for the learned are at issue, and
have long been stumbling over the two styles&mdash;may afford some idea of
the treatment to which authors were submitted in the age we are
writing of. Having completed his play of "Andria," Terence was desirous
of getting it licensed, and applied to the Ædiles, who referred him to
Cæcilius, for an opinion on the manuscript. The critic being at dinner,
desired the dramatist to take a seat on a low stool, and read his piece,
so that Cæcilius might, at the same time, swallow his meal, and digest
the new comedy. Terence had read but a few verses, when the critic
declared he could not continue selfishly putting good things into his
own mouth, while so many good things were coming from the mouth of
his visitor. He was requested to put the comedy away until after the
dinner, which he was invited to share; and, having done so, the play
was finished over a glass or two of wine, which increased the enthusiasm
with which the author read, and the critic listened. Both were
delighted with each other. Their better acquaintance was drunk;
success to the comedy was drunk; their healths were drunk together;
and, ultimately, Cæcilius and Terence were drunk separately as well as
jointly, before the termination of the evening.</p>

<p>The plays of Terence, though of Greek origin, were moulded after a
fashion of his own, and what little of the material he borrowed was
almost immaterial to the value of his productions. He received for one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
of them "The Eunuchus," no less than 8000 sesterces (about £64),
which was, in those days, the largest sum that had ever been paid for a
five act comedy. After having been successful for some years, he
embarked, according to some authorities, for Greece&mdash;as our dramatists
embark occasionally for Boulogne&mdash;to lay in a new stock of pieces for
future translation. Other authorities assert that he went to Asia,
taking a number of translations with him, and was never heard of
again, the ship having been sunk, perhaps, by the weight of his too
heavy manuscripts.<br /><br /></p>

<p><br /><br />Among the writers of the period, we must not forget to mention
Ennius, a Calabrian, who gave lessons in Greek to the patrician youths,
at a small lodging on the Aventine. He is regarded as the father of
Latin poetry; but Latin poetry could profit little from the paternal
care of one whose devotion to the bottle rendered his own care of
himself frequently impossible. His productions are of a very fragmentary
kind; and, indeed, his habits of intemperance prevented him from
making any sustained effort. He was the boon companion of several
patricians, who helped him to ruin when alive, and gave him a monument
at his death;&mdash;one of them (Scipio Africanus) accommodating
the poet with a place in his tomb, so that the patron might literally go
down to posterity with the man of genius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
While on the subject of the drama, as represented at Rome in the
days of Plautus and Terence, we may refer to the fact that masks were
worn by the actors, which gave to a theatrical performance some absurd
and not very interesting features. There were several sets of masks
among the properties of a regular theatre, beginning with that of the
first tragic old man, which had a quantity of venerable white worsted
attached to it for hair, with cheeks as chalky as grief and tears, strong
enough to have washed out the fastest colour, might be supposed to
have rendered them. The mask of the second tragic old man was less
pale than that of the first, for he was not supposed to have attained to
that universal privilege of aged heroism,&mdash;a countenance sicklied o'er
with a pale coat of whitewash. The mask of the tragic young man, or
youthful hero, was remarkable for its luxuriant head of hair, which,
from the earliest days of the drama to the present hour, seems to be
accepted as the stage indication of a noble character. The tragic
masks for slaves embraced some interesting varieties, including a sharp
nose, intended to be indicative of many a blow from fortune's hand,&mdash;a
sunken eye, to bespeak a sorry look-out,&mdash;and, occasionally, long white
hair, quite straight, which was supposed to convey the idea of the party
having seen better days, though the analogy is difficult, unless the
lankiness of the locks may be held to show that a favourable turn has
in vain been waited for. The mask of a tragic lady had all those
signs of a genuine female in distress which are even to this day required
on the stage, where long black hair, in terribly straightened circumstances,
is the emblem of an anxious mind, which has long been a
stranger to curl-papers. When insanity, as well as anguish, had to be
represented by the mask, the hair was undivided in the centre, but floated
in wild profusion, as if the wearer had gone through a great deal, and as
if, whatever she had gone through, her hair had caught in the middle of.</p>

<p>The classical mask of the first comic old man was drawn excessively
mild and benevolent, to indicate that propensity for scattering purses
among the poor, and bestowing his daughter, with some millions of sesterces,
on young Lucius, which were the probable attributes of the Greek
and Latin stage veteran. There was also the mask of the testy old
man, who was represented perfectly bald, as if he was always taking
something or other into his head which had torn all the hair out of it.
The masks for comic young men had the ordinary characteristics of stage
humour, including red hair, pug noses, broad lips, and raised eyebrows,
which are in these days supplied from those recognised sources of
dramatic drollery, the burnt cork, the gum-pot, and the paint-box.</p>

<p>We might enumerate a long list of different masks, without introducing
any variety, for they were very nearly the same; but we have
shown enough to prove that the classical taste for which so many
clamour without knowing what they talk about, was very little, if
at all, above the modern standard. Some authorities<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> assert that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
masks were not worn in the earliest representations of the Roman
drama; but some of the oldest MS. of Terence contain figures of the
required masks, just as a play of the present day has prefixed to it a
list of the costumes of the characters. The admirers of the classical
may be grieved and astonished to hear that the taste, for the restoration
of which they so much pine, took greater delight in the deadly games
of the Circus, than in the lively representations of men and <a name="manners" id="manners"></a>manners.<br /><br /></p>

<p><br /><br />Historical literature was in a very humble condition, and had much, or
indeed all, the prolixity, with little of the accuracy, of a modern report for
a newspaper. It is, however, hardly fair to judge the authors severely for
writings which we have never seen, and are never likely to see; for they
have never come down to us, except in scraps&mdash;the result of the various
cuttings-up they have encountered at the hands of Polybius and other
critics. For the same reason, we are unable to praise conscientiously
the "Origines" of Cato, which has long ago been lost, and we are
unwilling to adopt the "opinions of the press," which have too often been
at the disposal of the member of a clique, or of the purchaser of a puffing
paragraph. Oratory always was, and always will be, an important art,
except in those countries which are so excessively republican and free,
that the people are free for every imaginable or imaginary purpose,
except to do as they please, and to say what they think proper. The
Romans took the art of rhetoric from the Greeks, but even a good thing
is distasteful if forced where it is not asked; and, when the Athenians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
sent three professed orators as propagandists of their art to Rome, the
foreign agitators were ordered&mdash;very properly&mdash;to quit the city.</p>

<p>As lawyers, the early Romans are entitled to high praise, and they
evinced their prudence by making juris-prudence an essential part of
their ordinary studies. The Roman youth were required to get the
Twelve Tables by heart, or rather, by head, which was supposed to be
sufficiently furnished when the whole of the Twelve Tables alluded to
were crammed into it.</p>

<p>The science of Medicine was not in very high repute among the early
Romans, and physic was, commercially speaking, in very little demand,
so that it would have been a mere drug if brought into the market. The
aristocratic families generally expected one of their slaves to know something
of the healing process, as they usually did of other arts or trades;
and a surgical operation, like a gardening operation, or any piece of merely
manual labour, was frequently entrusted to the hands of a simple bondsman.
Physic was scarcely known in Rome as a distinct pursuit, until the
year of the City 534 (<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 219), when the Greek physician Archagathus
opened a shop with an extensive stock, and an establishment of baths;
the expense of which would have plunged him into hot water, had not
the public come forward to make him a present of his premises. The
shops of the doctors were lounging places for the idle, who are always
the most profitable patients; for there is no ailing so troublesome as
that of having nothing to do, and abundance of time to do it in. The
Romans had made little advance in art, though they professed to show
their love for it by robbing other nations of their treasures. On the
same principle, the pickpocket, who pilfers a handkerchief, might ask
credit for being attracted by the beauty of its design; and the knave
who walks away with a set of silver spoons might pretend to be actuated
by a desire to patronise their pattern or their workmanship. Rome,
indeed, can scarcely be said to have introduced the arts from Greece,
but merely to have introduced a few of the articles on which the arts
had employed themselves.</p>

<p>Commerce was looked down upon for a long period as a degrading
pursuit; but from the time of the Second Punic War, the equites, with
a total disregard of equity, began lending out money at exorbitant
interest. Though they would not condescend to trade for gain, they
were prepared to pocket the profits of usury. They would also purchase
corn at a low price abroad, and sell it at a dear rate at home; for they
understood and practised all the tricks of the tradesman, though they
sneered at and repudiated his position. The slave trade was also
carried on to a vast extent by the higher classes, and even Cato is said
to have done a little in that way himself, notwithstanding the stiffness
of his notions, and the alleged purity of his morals. The patrician
principle seemed to be, that the same thing which would be blamable
on a small scale, was excusable when practised on a broad basis&mdash;that to
sell a little was degrading, but to sell a great deal was no disgrace at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
all; and by a parity of reasoning, they must have held, that so far from
its being the same thing whether to be hanged for a sheep or a lamb,
it would only be the smaller depredator who would deserve any punishment
whatever.</p>

<p>Robbery had greatly augmented the public wealth; but individuals
were wretchedly poor, with the exception of the few who had had a
hand in the pockets of the conquered nations. Slaves were brought in
such numbers to Rome, that at length they would hardly fetch a price;
and so many were brought from Sardinia, who were constantly being
put up, knocked down at nothing, bought in, and left on hand, that
"Sardians to sell!" passed into a proverb to express an unsaleable
article. In vain were the poor creatures prepared to do as they were
bid, for no one would give them a bidding. The Greek captives
fetched a higher price, for they were many of them accomplished men,
and became tutors, music-masters, or teachers of painting, in the
families of their purchasers. Among the hostages brought to Rome,
was Polybius the historian, who got so good a living by giving lessons,
that though he had been brought to Rome against his will, he solicited
the privilege of remaining there. His "Universal History," in forty books,
was a work that ought to be, and would have been, in every gentleman's
library, but for the unfortunate fact of its having been nearly all lost:
and we may judge of the excellence of the whole, from the knowledge
that though what remains of the work is very good, by far the best
part of it is missing.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br />CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIRST.</h2>

<h3>WARS AGAINST PERSEUS. THE THIRD PUNIC WAR. SIEGE AND DESTRUCTION<br />
OF CARTHAGE, AND DITTO DITTO OF CORINTH.<br /><br /></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span> of Macedon bad been from time to time waging war with
Rome; but the wages of the troops were so exhausting to his means,
that he was driven to a hollow peace by his empty pockets. He had
agreed to confine his dominion within a certain space; but, as his
ambition had no bounds, he would not be content that his territory
should have any limits. He accordingly fought with and thrashed the
Thracians, who sent ambassadors to Rome for the purpose of showing
him up, as it were, to their common master. Rome punished him by
ordering him to keep within bounds; and threatened, that if he should
be found venturing out of bounds, he should be severely punished.
Philip muttered something about seeking justice elsewhere&mdash;a threat
of paulo-post-future revenge which is common with those who, being
engaged in a dispute, have got decidedly the worst of it.</p>

<p>His prospects of ulterior measures were, however, sufficiently remote
to induce him to attempt an arrangement through the intervention of
his son Demetrius. The latter had been educated in Rome, and of
course had a thorough understanding of the Roman character. He
succeeded in his mission, but he obtained his end in a less agreeable
sense; for his existence was brought to a close by treachery. Some
designing persons fomented a feeling of jealousy between himself and
his elder brother, Perseus, who poisoned the mind of Philip with such
fatal effect, that he caused the poisoning&mdash;not merely mental, but
physical&mdash;of his son Demetrius. When the wretched parent discovered
that he had been duped, he became so uneasy in his mind, that
he went quite out of it, and died at the age of three-score, unable to
meet the heavy score that he had run up against himself in the court of
his own conscience.</p>

<p>Perseus was hailed by the Romans as king; but all their hailing
could not render his reign prosperous. He endeavoured to cement his
power by a marriage with the daughter of Antiochus Epiphanes,
for Perseus thought that the aid he would derive from the match,
would render him more than a match for his enemies. He gave his
sister to Prusias of Bithynia, in the hope that the latter, having married
into the family, would feel himself wedded to its interests. Avarice was,
however, the ruin of Perseus; for he did not understand the true use
of the purse, which he used his utmost exertions to fill, and then held
its strings with parsimonious stringency. He had promised to pay
his allies, but their zeal in his cause subsided when they were left
without their subsidies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Eumenes of Pergamus being among others seized with a panic, went
to Rome to ask advice, and on his return nearly lost his life on the
highway, by some persons who attacked him in a very low manner. He
was passing a narrow footpath near Delphi&mdash;from which it would appear
that he had walked at least a portion of the way&mdash;when some persons
concealed in the rocks, hurled down several large blocks of granite,
which though not causing his death, brought him within a stone's
throw of it. Several huge pieces having fallen upon him, something
struck him that all was not right; and he was revolving the affair in
his mind, when he found himself rolling down the precipice. He was
picked up nearly lifeless, but though very much jammed, he was
preserved; and though almost dashed to pieces, he was sufficiently collected,
in a few days, to be enabled to go home, by another road, to Asia.
It was said that Perseus had had a hand in this disgraceful affair; but
he declared that even if he had wished for the death of Eumenes, he
would not have been guilty of making such a desperate push for it.</p>

<p>This circumstance gave an impetus to the hostilities between Rome
and Perseus, who was driven by the Consul Paulus Æmilius to a place
called Pydna, where the two armies came to such very close quarters,
that their cavalry were compelled to go halves in the same stream of
water. A Roman horse happened to be drinking, when, startled by his
own shadow, and not giving himself time for reflection, which would
have shown him the cause of his alarm, he ran away into the camp of
the enemy. The animal, though goaded on by nothing but the spur of
the moment, continued his flight; and some Roman soldiers running
after him into the enemy's camp, were speedily followed by so many
more, that, though they had come after their own horse, they began
attacking the foot of the enemy.</p>

<p>The battle was commenced under such unfavourable circumstances,
that Æmilius, the Roman leader, thinking it all lost, declared that it
was all one to him what became of him. He manifested his grief by
tearing his robe to show how much he was cut up; and beating his
foot impatiently on the ground, he stamped himself for ever as a man
without strength of mind, in a case where fortitude was required. The
Roman cavalry beginning to bear down successfully, the Consul began
to bear up; and the tide of fortune being turned, the Macedonians
were, according to those grave authorities&mdash;which never mince matters,
though always mincing men&mdash;cut, as usual, to pieces. Perseus flew to
Pella; but having omitted to close the gates after him, he was shut out
from all chance of escape had he remained in the place, and he went on,
therefore, to Amphipolis. There he attempted to address the inhabitants
on his own behalf; but he shed so many tears, that he drowned
his own voice, and choked his own utterance. He had hoped to rouse
the inhabitants by going to the country with a cry; but he damped their
enthusiasm with a flood of tears, when they had been looking for a flow
of eloquence.</p>

<p>After flying from place to place, like a hunted hare, he felt the game
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
was up, and, retreating to Samothrace, he consigned his weary head to
the shelter of Castor, in whose temple he hid himself. He had
managed to carry about with him a large supply of treasure, which he
was anxious to save, and had hired a mariner to take him to Crete;
but the money having been first sent on board, the crafty seaman, out
of curiosity, weighed the gold, and immediately weighed anchor.
Perseus having gone down to the beach, to embark, saw the ship in the
offing, and, having watched it, he perceived that it was fairly, or rather
unfairly off, with all his treasure. As he paced the shore, he felt
himself quite aground, and, having no lodging for the night, or the
means of obtaining one, he returned to the solitary chambers of the
temple. Having a wife and family to provide for, he threw himself on
the generosity of Æmilius, who gave him a subsistence, but loaded him
with chains, that he might feel the weight of his obligations. The
unhappy Perseus was made to walk in a triumph before the car of his
conqueror; and though he had entreated that he might not be so
lowered, he was still further let down, by cruel confinement in a subterranean
dungeon. His fellow-prisoners are said to have offered him a
sword, to end his days, but, on looking at the weapon, he very properly
declined to bring his sufferings to a point, by an act of folly and wickedness.
He eventually found his way to Alba, where he died in about
two years; his son, Alexander, having adopted the trade of a turner,
with the laudable view of turning an honest penny.</p>

<p>Paulus Æmilius exercised the usual privilege of a conqueror, by
robbing the vanquished of all they had possessed; and Macedonia was
declared free, in the customary manner, by placing it entirely under the
government of its foreign victors.</p>

<p>The triumph of Paulus Æmilius was one of the most magnificent
shows that had ever been seen, and lasted three days, during which a
perpetual fair was kept up; for, among the Romans, "None but the brave
deserve the fair" was a maxim literally followed. On the first day there
was a procession of pictures, showing the exploits of Æmilius in the
brightest colours. The second day was devoted to the carrying of the
trophies and the silver coin; but, on the third, which was the grandest
day of all, the gold was paraded, followed by 120 bulls, which seem to
be suggestive of nothing belonging to war but its butchery. After
these came the unhappy Perseus, loaded with fetters, and having about
him some other links of a far more affecting kind, in the shape of his
three children.</p>

<p>The fame spread by the fate of Perseus was general among the kings
of the earth, who flocked like sheep, or rather, crawled like curs, to do
homage to the Roman Senate. Perseus arrived with his head shaved,
as if to show that he owed not only his crown, but his hair and all, to
Rome; and he wore the tattered garments of a freed slave, as if to
prove that he had not a rag to his back, but what he held at the
pleasure of his masters.</p>

<p>All who had shown any sympathy with the cause of Perseus were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
cruelly persecuted, and the unfortunate Rhodians were so terrified with
the bare anticipation of their fate, that they began to anticipate it in
reality, by making away with themselves and with one another. On
the few who remained the hardest conditions were imposed, which
made their own condition the more deplorable. Carthage and the
Achaian League were the only two powers that seemed to stand in the
way of Rome, and of these the latter was thought so contemptible, that
some Achaians who had been detained in Italy were saved by a sarcasm
of Cato on their feebleness and decrepitude. "We have only to decide,"
said he, "whether these poor creatures shall be buried by their own
grave-diggers, or by ours;" a cruel pleasantry, which, however, had a
humane result, for it was decided that they should be at liberty to go
home and yield to their native undertakers the profit&mdash;or loss&mdash;attendant
on their funerals.</p>

<p>The Carthaginians had been for some years at peace with Rome, but
had been much harassed by some of her allies, and particularly by
Massinissa, their neighbour, in Numidia. It was annoying enough to
be subjected to attack, but it was still more provoking to be unable to
return the blow, which was the case with Carthage, whose hands were
tied by a bond prohibiting her from going to war without Rome's
permission. An appeal was addressed to Rome, which sent ambassadors,
who were instructed to hear the Carthaginians, but to decide in favour
of Massinissa. Carthage at length grew tired of allowing Rome to hold
the scales of justice; for, though the scales might have been true, a
false weight was always attached to one side, which gave it a vast
preponderance.</p>

<p>The Carthaginians, therefore, took up arms against Massinissa, who,
though ninety years of age, fought with great determination; for he felt,
probably, that he was too old to fly, and that his only chance was to
make that determined stand so well adapted to a time of life when
progress is somewhat difficult. The Carthaginians were worsted, but
they were not yet quite at their worst, until Rome was seized with the
idea of destroying their city. Cato was especially bent upon this
design, or rather he pursued it with unbending obstinacy, for he
finished every speech with the words "<i>Delenda est Carthago</i>," which
may be freely rendered into "Carthage must be smashed." Whatever
might have been the commencement of his oration, he always ended
with the same words, and whether he spoke in the Senate, the market-place,
or his own house, though the premises might be different, he
always came to the same conclusion. He went about as a man with
one idea, and his conduct was almost that of a monomaniac; for, if he
met a friend in the street, and conversed on different or indifferent
subjects, he would take his farewell with the accustomed words, "<i>Valete;
delenda est Carthago</i>,"&mdash;"Good-bye; we must smash Carthage." During
a debate in the Senate he pulled some figs out of his pocket, which he
exhibited to some of his brother members as being "remarkably fine."
As the fruit was being examined, he observed, that he had "picked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
them up in Africa;" that "they were capital;" that "there were plenty
more where those came from," and, in a word, he added, "<i>Delenda est
Carthago</i>"&mdash;"We really must smash Carthage."</p>

<p>Rome agreed with Cato, more especially when he pointed out that the
place was exceedingly rich; for the Romans, whenever there was anything
to be got by robbery, were quite prepared for violence. The Consuls,
M. Manilius and L. Marcius Censorinus, assembled with a large force
in Sicily, where some ambassadors appeared from Carthage; but the
only result of negotiation was an order that 300 members of the best
Carthaginian families should be sent over by way of hostages. The
Romans then passed over into Utica, where the Carthaginian ambassadors
again tried to treat, but the treatment they experienced was a
demand for the instant giving up of all their arms and ammunition.
Commissioners were sent into the city to see the orders carried out,
which comprised the carrying out of 200,000 suits of armour, and 3000
catapults.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The Carthaginians appear to have lost the use of their
heads when they so quietly resigned their arms; but when they were
told that they must, in the next place, abandon Carthage, and build
another city ten miles off, they began to feel&mdash;somewhat too late&mdash;that
it was time to defend themselves.</p>

<p>The Carthaginian ambassadors proceeded to the usual expression of
anguish by tearing their hair out by the roots, instead of trying to pluck
up a little courage. Some, who were already bald, rolled themselves in
the dust; and only a few went, like sensible men, to communicate to
the Carthaginians the doom with which their city was threatened.</p>

<p>The receipt of the news seems to have deprived the Carthaginians of
all their natural intelligence; for their first step was to maltreat the
envoys. An effort was then made to save the city, by shutting the
gates; and the citizens armed themselves with stones, having determined
to set their lives upon the cast of these unwarlike missiles. It
is impossible not to respect and admire the heroism displayed under the
very trying circumstances; but, unfortunately, trying was of little use,
for the chances were all against the Carthaginians. Hasdrubal, who
had been living in exile, at the head of 20,000 men&mdash;a somewhat large
party to remain in banishment&mdash;was sent for to take the command, and
occupied a post outside the city. The inhabitants, having given up all
their ordinary arms to the enemy, supplied fresh ammunition by devoting
all their gold and silver to the furnace; and it was a melting sight to
see their treasure sacrificed for this patriotic object. The women cut
off their hair, to devote it to the making of crossbows, and the sex took
a characteristic pride in furnishing as many strings to a bow as possible.
They worked so energetically, that they are said to have fabricated as
many as 500 javelins, 140 bucklers, and 300 swords each day; but this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
statement seems to involve so much of fabrication, that we find difficulty
in believing it.</p>

<p>The resistance of Carthage was obstinate; and the confidence of
Rome led to a sort of indolence on the part of the latter, which protracted
the siege, until a new life was put into the affair, by the
appointment of young P. C. Scipio, the son of Paulus Æmilius, to the
Consulship. The Carthaginians also were urged to fresh exertion, and
a party of 300 waded through the harbour, with torches in their hands,
to burn some engines; but the water damped their efforts, which might
be compared to an attempt to set the Thames on fire; and all who were
not drowned were glad to make their way back again. The suggestion of
the use of flame was an unfortunate one for Carthage, since it seemed
to cause the breaking in of a new light upon the Romans, who had
recourse to incendiarism in their turn for the accomplishment of their
object. Having got within the walls, they ignited several houses, and,
carrying fire from street to street, they invested their cause with a glare
which is none the less hateful for having been the glare of victory.</p>

<p>After nearly everybody had been killed, 50,000 men and women came
forth with olive branches to meet the conqueror; and 900 Roman
deserters were still stowed away in the citadel. Hasdrubal yielded; but
his wife, who was a strong-minded woman, reviled him in a speech from
the ramparts, and, parading her poor helpless children up and down for
a few minutes, she threw them before her, and ultimately flung herself
into the burning ruins. Preceding historians have expressed their
admiration of this frantic female, for the act of murder and suicide which
we have described; but we must confess our total inability to appreciate
the heroism of a piece of cruelty and cowardice, involving a large
amount of brutal daring, but wholly destitute of moral fortitude.</p>

<p>Carthage was now utterly destroyed, and Scipio, who had been the
main instrument of its having been set on fire, is said to have shed tears
over its smouldering ashes; but we should be inclined to attribute the
fact to the smoke having got into his eyes, rather than to any feeling of
humanity. Even those who give him credit for sensibility, accuse him of
selfishness, for they say that he alluded to the possibility that the same
fate would befal his own country; and they add that, while thinking of
his home, he quoted Homer, who had foretold the doom of Troy through
the mouth of Hector.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The Romans having possession of the place,
razed to the ground every part that had escaped the flames; but they
lowered themselves even still more completely than they levelled the
city. Thus fell a place which had maintained a noble rivalry with
Rome, and which, in many respects, surpassed her proud competitor.</p>

<p>The greatness of Carthage had been, undoubtedly, the cause of that
littleness of feeling which had been manifested towards it by Cato, who
could not bear the idea that there should exist a city rivalling in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
grandeur the place he inhabited. The walls, which were triple, were
divided into two stories, the upper for men, and the lower for brutes;
the former comprising barracks for soldiers, and the latter being fitted
up as stables for elephants.</p>

<p>The chief glory of the place was, however, to be found in its aqueducts,
which ran in a long line of seventy miles, and of which the people had
more reason to be proud than of even a still longer line of ancestors.
That a place surrounded almost by aqueducts should have been destroyed
by fire, is an extraordinary fact, though it is possible that turncocks may
have been neglectful, and if called upon to turn the water on, they may
have turned it off in favour of some more agreeable engagement.</p>

<p>There were not so many spoils as had been expected, for everything
was spoilt by the mischief that had been done, and though there had
been plenty of gold, the fearful amount of violent change had so
scattered the gold, that there was not so much remaining as there
otherwise would have been. With a touch of that honour which the
proverb says is to be found among thieves, Scipio called upon the
places formerly plundered by Carthage to reclaim their goods; and
the people of Agrigentum demanded a brazen Bull they had once used
as an instrument of torture, though the invention was so discreditable
to humanity, that its inventors ought to have been ashamed to ask for it
back again. Among the prizes secured by the Romans, was a very
small parcel of books, including a little work on agriculture, by Mago,
which had taught the Carthaginians to till the earth, though not how
to keep their ground, for they had lost every foot of it.</p>

<p>Carthage became a province of Rome, under the name of Africa, and
Scipio, who subsequently styled himself Africanus, enjoyed one of those
triumphs, which were in fact disgraces to the object they were designed
to honour. Part of the "triumph" consisted in the barbarity of throwing
as food to lions the fugitives that had fallen into his hands, and
games were celebrated, in which death to the conquered was the chief
sport to the conqueror.</p>

<p>Macedonia, which was groaning under the freedom forced upon it by
Rome, was glad to become the slave of everybody who offered to ease it
of the obnoxious burden. The Macedonians, therefore, became the
dupes of three impostors in succession, who, with all their imposition,
were less objectionable than the hardships imposed by Rome in her
character of liberator to the world in general. The impostors&mdash;one of
whom was a runaway gladiator&mdash;were in turn subdued, and Macedonia
was swallowed up by Rome's insatiable appetite for conquest.</p>

<p>Of the three pretenders just alluded to, the only one who had been
able to maintain his ground&mdash;though, by the way, the ground was
never his to maintain&mdash;was a young man, who declared himself to be
Philip, the son of Perseus. The youth was certainly very like his
alleged father; and, upon the strength of the resemblance in features,
he put upon his claim such a bold face, that the Macedonians favoured
it. They put their crown upon his head, and the kingly name seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
to have invested the young adventurer with a tower of strength; for he
was successful in an attack upon the Romans, under the consul
Juventius. The impostor, however, soon lost control over himself,
and there was at once an end to his influence over his new subjects.
They threw him off, and he was compelled to take refuge in a Court
inhabited by one Bysas, a petty Thracian prince, who gave up, or, more
probably, sold, the fugitive, who had sought his hospitality. The pretender,
who had led away so many others, was eventually led away
himself, and made to march as a "frightful example" in the triumph
of Metellus.</p>

<p>About this time the Achaians, who had entered into a league, began
to quarrel among themselves; for Sparta, like a spoiled child, wanted
to have its own way, and sulked, as it were, alone in a corner, apart
from the rest of the confederacy. Rome was appealed to for advice,
and Roman ambassadors came to Corinth; but they were so unpopular,
that on a visit to the theatre, where they had gone, expecting fair play,
they were insulted and pelted by the audience. This irritated the
Romans, and an army was sent, under Mummius, to encounter the
Greek general Diæus, who made so certain of victory, that he had
seats erected for the women and children to see him win a battle. He
had prepared everything in the neighbourhood of Corinth, and appropriating
the privilege of the brave who are said to deserve the fair, he
clustered a large bevy of female beauty round the spot of his intended
achievement. The ladies were all expectation, and Diæus was all
confidence, until Mummius made his appearance, and in a very few
minutes sent Diæus flying towards Megalopolis. Here he entered his
own abode, and setting fire to the premises, celebrated, with the most
dismal of house-warmings, the defeat that took the place of his intended
victory.</p>

<p>Mummius, thinking it idle to pursue the fugitive, preferred following
up his advantage, and arrived at the gates of Corinth, which had been
left wide open by the citizens. The place was deserted; and Mummius
not only sacked its palaces, but ransacked its private houses, and,
looking into its magazines, extracted from them some very valuable
articles. So little, however, did he understand or appreciate art, that
when sending valuable pictures or pieces of sculpture to Rome, he told
the sailors, that if any damage was done on the voyage, he would make
them execute objects precisely similar to those with which he entrusted
them. Among the pictures was the celebrated "Bacchus" of Aristides,&mdash;which
was so perfect as to be looked upon as one of the wonders of
the world&mdash;and, when consigning it as part of a cargo of curiosities, he
declared that, if any injury was done to it, the ship's painter should
immediately paint another. Such was the barbarism of the destroyers
of Corinth, that this picture was only rescued by Polybius from the
hands of the soldiers, who were gambling on its face, and who, with
every throw of the die, took off a portion of its colour.</p>

<p>The scenes enacted during the pillage of Corinth were barbarous in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the extreme, and involved the total destruction of what may have been
termed one of the chief pillars of civilisation&mdash;or, at all events, its
Corinthian capital. Many of the Roman soldiers, intoxicated with
success and something more, perished in the flames, to which the city
was doomed by the barbarous order of Mummius. When the conflagration
first commenced, it is said that a liquid metal was seen to flow through
the streets, which induced the invaders to rush forward in the hope
of profiting by such a strange metallic currency. Those, however,
who laid their hands upon the tempting issue, as it ran from the banks
on either side of the thoroughfare, found it a mass of floating fire, with
which they terribly burned their fingers. On cooler examination the
material proved to be a fusion of beautiful ores, to which the name of
Corinthian brass has since <a name="been_given" id="been_given"></a>been given.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Bacchanalian Group, from a very old Vase.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />Greece was now at the feet of Rome, which trampled not only on her
fallen foe, but upon all the obligations of honour and morality. The
population and wealth of Corinth were disposed of&mdash;the former by
murder, and the latter by robbery. Greece was formed into a Roman
province under the title of Achaia, and Mummius, glorying in, rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
than being ashamed of, his share of the work, took the surname of
Achaicus. We may instance as a redeeming feature of the period, the
erection at Rome of a clock, which was in some degree at variance with
the time; for the useful arts were neglected amid the pursuits of war
and rapine. The clock consisted of a bottle with a narrow neck, filled
with water, divided into twelve measures, to mark the hours; but it
was only a minute observer that could ascertain the minutes. The only
mode of telling the time at Rome, had been previously by means of
the sun-dial, which was, of course, useless in the absence of sun, and
those who were particular to a shade, could derive from it no assistance
in their evening arrangements.</p>

<p>We dwell with some satisfaction on the introduction of the apparatus
we have described; for the mere manifestation of a desire to note the
progress of time is indicative of a wish to make an improved use of it.
The application of the bottle to a wholesome purpose must also be a
cheering symptom, when it is met with among those who had previously
looked at the bottle as the means of killing time, rather than as an
instrument for making its flight perceptible.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br />CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SECOND.</h2>

<h3>WARS IN SPAIN. VIRIATHUS. DESTRUCTION OF NUMANTIA. THE SERVILE<br />
WAR IN SICILY. APPROPRIATION OF PERGAMUS.<br /><br /></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">War</span> had become so familiar to the Romans, that they never felt at
home unless they were fighting abroad, and the sword was the only
thing they took in hand with real earnestness. The intoxication of
success, like other habits of intoxication, cannot be easily got rid of, and
the Romans sought to indulge their thirst for conquest in a manner
wholly at variance with sober judgment. Their design was to conquer
Spain, and in the execution of this design they cruelly executed large
numbers of the Lusitanians, who had laid down their arms, in consequence
of a promise that if they quitted the field of battle, they
should be allowed quiet possession of the fields of peaceful industry.
On this assurance, they divided themselves into three parts, and were
then&mdash;as we are gravely assured by the chroniclers&mdash;treacherously cut
into several thousand pieces. One of the few that escaped was
Viriathus, who combined the qualities of the wolf and the lamb, for
he had turned a desperate robber, after having been employed as a
gentle shepherd. Abandoning the honest hook of a pastoral life, he had
adopted the more crooked ways of the common thief; and he seems
to have gradually stolen upon the confidence of his countrymen, until
they made him a general. He had passed his early days among the
mountains, and was prepared for the ups and downs of life, which he
afterwards experienced. His predatory properties had taught him how
to attack, and his practice as a robber&mdash;which rendered it necessary for
him frequently to keep out of the way&mdash;had familiarised him with the
art of avoiding an enemy. He would appear suddenly from the thick of
a thicket, and after doing considerable mischief, he would find concealment
in the hollow of some rock which his companions would never
split upon. Though he had commenced his career as a poor country
clown, he had trained himself to perform feats of activity worthy of the
most experienced Harlequin. Life, which is a drama in the case of
most men, was, in his case, a series of scenes in a pantomime. He was
here, there, and everywhere, when he was not expected, and he was
immediately nowhere when his opponents were in pursuit of him. His
policy was first to scatter, and then to destroy; to divide an enemy <i>en gros</i>,
and cut it to pieces <i>en detail</i>. He had encountered Vitellius, the Roman
Prætor, near a place called Tribula, where the latter got into the utmost
tribulation by being led through briers and bushes into an ambush,
where he lost half his army. The other half lost him, for he was
killed by the sword of some one who did not know him, though, had he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
been known, the acquaintance would, most probably, have been cut in
the same barbarous manner.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 412px;">
<img src="images/i_p0226.png" width="412" height="500" alt="Assassination of Viriathus." title="" />
<span class="caption">Assassination of Viriathus.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />Viriathus for some time baffled the enemy by cunning and address,
or rather by having no address at all, for he had no fixed residence;
and there was, consequently, much difficulty in finding him. At length
he fought a battle, in which he was so far successful that a peace was
concluded, in which he was acknowledged as the friend and ally of
Rome; but having no one to save him from his friends, he was basely
murdered in his sleep by some Lusitanian assassins that the Roman
general had hired. The instigators of this barbarous act refused to pay
when the sanguinary work was done; and the murderers, in making a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
demand on account of their crime, may be said to have, figuratively, cut
their own throats, for they were threatened with punishment for the
iniquity they confessed themselves guilty of. After the death of
Viriathus, the Lusitanians having lost their head, were without the
brains necessary to defend themselves, and fell an easy prey into the
hands of Q. Pompeius. This individual was the son of a musician; but
instead of following his father's profession, he had become the leader of
a warlike band, and he found the soldiers willing instruments to play
into his hands, or act in concert with him, for the gratification of his
personal ambition. He attacked Numantia, though with so little success,
that he was compelled to conclude a peace; but treacherously declaring
that the conclusion of a peace meant the beginning of a war, he renewed
hostilities at the first convenient opportunity. Subsequently, C. Hostilius
Mancinus commenced an attack, but 10,000 of his men having been
killed, and 20,000 more being blocked up in a ravine, he could not
exactly see his way out of it without a surrender. The Numantines
refused to treat with him, until young Tib. Sempronius Gracchus,
whom they trusted, came forward to pledge his honour that Numantia
should be fairly treated. The Senate, however, repudiated the arrangement,
and the honour of young Tib. remains among the enormous stock
of unredeemed pledges which history has handed down to us.</p>

<p>The Romans began to feel that none but the best man was likely to
win, and they accordingly looked out for the best man, whom they found
in Scipio Africanus, the destroyer of Carthage. He was sent against
Numantia, which he surrounded by fortifications, in order that he might
starve out the inhabitants by keeping them in, and he did his utmost to
restore the discipline of the Roman army. He hardened the soldiers by
making them carry loads of wood, a novel plan of providing them with a
billet; he forced them to sleep on the ground, which they complained
of as hard; and he allowed them no other cooking utensils than a
saucepan, which caused the indignation of many to boil over.</p>

<p>Numantia stood upon a lofty rock, and its inhabitants displayed a
courage worthy of its high position. The river Durius (now the Douro)
washed its feet; there were forests on either hand; while the mounds
and ditches abounding in the vale before it, rendered any attempt to
approach it in the front almost unavailable. Scipio Africanus soon
perceived the hopelessness of succeeding by a direct attack, and he proceeded,
therefore, to raise round the place a double stockade, to prevent
any aid in the form of a stock of provisions being carried into it. He
impeded the navigation of the river by throwing across it large beams,
perforated with swords, which, revolving with the tide, cut off all communication
by means of water.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the precautions that had been taken, a party of
about half-a-dozen young men, having slipped through the lines&mdash;and
very hard lines they were&mdash;succeeded in reaching the town of Lutia.
The head of the party, holding an olive-branch, begged for assistance
with such effect, that the Lutians offered to lend him a hand in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
terrible emergency. Scipio, who had been in pursuit, no sooner heard
of the Lutians having offered to lend a hand, than he savagely declared
that they should have no hands to spare, and he barbarously ordered the
cutting off of the hands of four hundred citizens.</p>

<p>The Numantines being completely hemmed in, were unable to obtain
provisions; but though reduced at last to eat cats, they became only the
more dogged in their resistance to the enemy. Eventually, they begged
for a truce of three days, which they employed in destroying their wives
and children&mdash;a species of heroism not easily understood; for to kill
those who are dear, by way of protecting them, is a mode of insurance of
which we must dispute the policy. The men were so sadly dispirited,
and so fearfully cut up by their own or each other's swords, that the
conquerors had only a remnant to take, in the shape of population, when
they entered the city.</p>

<p>In conformity with the custom of the period, Scipio Africanus Minor,
whose atrocities, in connexion with the siege of Numantia, have branded
his name for ever with disgrace, proceeded to make arrangements for a
triumph. Instead of feeling a decent shame, he manifested a most
unbecoming pride in what he had done; and to identify himself more
completely with the horrors of the siege, he took the name of Numantinus.
So thoroughly had starvation done its work, that of the few
citizens who were found alive, only fifty were in sufficiently good condition
to appear in the show got up in celebration of his dishonourable
victory.</p>

<p>While Rome was thus extending her arms, she may be said to have
been painfully on the stretch; and Scipio, during his consulship, seeing
the republic was likely to outgrow its strength, caused prayers to be
said for its safety. Rome was certainly in danger, though from a
different cause than that which had been apprehended; for the free
population had been greatly reduced by war, and the captives, or slaves
to circumstances, had been vastly multiplied. The office of the latter
was to tend flocks; and they were so thoroughly regarded as a portion
of the stock, that they were treated like brutes by their masters.</p>

<p>The system of slavery which existed at Rome, had so much influence
upon her fate, and is calculated to afford such an insight into her morals,
that the fetters she placed upon others may be regarded as so many
links in her history. We will, therefore, break for a moment the chain
of narrative, and proceed to a brief consideration of the Roman system
of slavery and chains, to which we cannot hope that the attention of the
reader can remain long riveted.</p>

<p>According to the strict letter of the Roman law, a master could treat,
or maltreat, his slave in any way he pleased, either by death, sale, or
punishment. Though the slave could hold no property, he had the
power of taking anything he could get, but simply as a medium for conveying
it to his master. So thoroughly were the slaves looked upon as
articles of traffic, that they were liable to be pledged or put into pawn&mdash;a
position in which they were the subjects of a melancholy sort of interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
The demand for slave labour in Rome was caused by the annual
consumption of the free population in war, at whose bidding many who
should have remained to cultivate the land, were sent forth to plough
the ocean. The result was a redundancy of slave population, accustomed
to agricultural labour of every kind, and which, having been already
brought under the yoke, had become sufficiently brutalised to do the
work of oxen. The chief supply of slaves was drawn from the prisoners
taken in war, and an army was generally attended by dealers, who, in
case of a glut, could frequently buy a lot cheap; and at the camp of
Lucullus they were being picked up for about three shillings and three-pence
of our money&mdash;or four drachmas. In Rome it was usual to sell
slaves by auction, and, as if the poor wretches were not already low
enough, they were knocked down by the hammer. The dealers were in
the habit of practising the same sort of tricks to conceal the defects of a
slave, as are, in these days, employed to hide the faults of a horse, and
it was customary therefore, in purchasing, to require a warranty. The
character was often suspended on a scroll round the neck, and their
chief recommendation consisted in a guarantee that they would neither
commit suicide, nor steal&mdash;having no tendency to make away with
either themselves or their master's property. There was a considerable
variation in the value of slaves, and fancy prices have been
known to be given for some curious specimens of captive humanity.
A fool has been known to fetch 20,000 sesterces&mdash;about one hundred
and seventy pounds&mdash;a sum that would seem to show that folly was
scarce; but when we remember how wise a man is required to make a
fool, we may take it for granted that the wisdom comprised in the
subject of the bargain was the rare and costly part of it. Literary men
were often exposed for sale like cattle when they happened to be slaves,
and the useful hack, or occasionally the literary lion, might be seen
chained to a pen in the public market-place. Slaves had no distinctive
dress; and when it was once proposed to give them one, the measure
was rejected, on the ground that it might show them their numerical
strength, and that if they once saw their power by obtaining their livery,
they might attempt to take up their freedom. It was deemed better to
keep them in the dark, by clothing them in sombre colours, and their
numbers not being manifested to them by any peculiar dress, it was
not likely they would unite in order to redress their grievances.</p>

<p>There is, however, something elastic in human nature, which causes it to
rise after being trodden on. Such was the case with the slaves, who began
to swell with indignation, which was rendered particularly tumid by the
inflated and inflating eloquence of one Eunus, a Syrian, who was a
member of their own body. This individual possessed the art of
oratory in a high degree, and there is nothing more stimulating to the
breeze of discontent than the breath of an enthusiastic demagogue.
He persuaded the slaves to revolt, and while preaching to them the
doctrine of equality, he claimed to be not only their leader, but their
prince and ruler&mdash;a species of practice which is not uncommon with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
propounders of the most levelling theories. Pretending to possess the
gift of prophecy, he predicted that he would be a king one day; and
the rich, putting a mimic crown on his head for a few hours, jeeringly
told him that he had been a king one day&mdash;or at least half a day, and
that his prediction had been therefore verified. The slaves, however,
put faith in him, and shouldering their spades, axes, poles, and hatchets,
made themselves, as well as their implements, the tools of Eunus. No
less than 70,000 slaves acknowledged as their head the man who taught
them that they ought to have no head at all, and he urged them to a
merciless massacre of their vanquished foes, while inculcating the
doctrines of humanity. Rage without restraint, and revenge without
reason, were, however, of no permanent avail, and the slaves under
Eunus were soon routed by the disciplined forces of the Consul, Rupilius.
He besieged Tauromenium; and the slaves, by being completely shut
in, were altogether shut out from the chance of obtaining provisions.
Their condition from day to day was so desperate and monotonous, that,
with nothing to eat, they furnish but sorry food to the historian.
Having swallowed their last morsel, the inhabitants could not satisfy
their hunger by bolting the gates, and Rupilius was admitted within the
city. Eunus escaped into a cutting in the rocks; but when he relied
on the friendly shelter of the cave, he found it a hollow mockery. His
retreat was discovered, and he was taken into custody with his cook, his
confectioner, his butler, and his buffoon, who, with the exception of the
last, must have held sinecures in their master's limited establishment.
The buffoon must have been worked the hardest of the party, for the
pursuit of mirth under difficulties is one of the most melancholy tasks
that can be imposed on the professed humorist. Eunus himself was
transferred from his subterranean cellar to an underground cell, where
it is said he was devoured by rats; but happily this horrid tale receives
no authentic ratification at the hands of history.</p>

<p>The Servile War had not yet ceased, when Attalus, the King of
Pergamus, died, and left no sign; for there was no succeeding king's
head for the crown of Pergamus to rest upon. It was fortunate,
perhaps, that Attalus left no heir; for had there been any inheritor of
his qualities as well as his title, the perpetuation of a nuisance would
have been the deplorable consequence. The man was so thoroughly
wicked that it is charity to pronounce him mad, and we accordingly
set him down as a lunatic, though we feel scarcely justified in acquitting
him of his many crimes on the single ground of insanity. He is said
to have been so much addicted to the practice of poisoning his relations,
that he found it cheaper to grow his own plants; and he cultivated the
hemlock, or the night-shade, as others grew their own faba or cicer, their
beans and chickweed. Death lurked at the root of everything his
garden contained, and it is probable that he sent many a present of
putative mushrooms to his unsuspecting kindred. So odious had he
become, that it is said he would have been murdered, if he had not died
a little too soon for the arrangements of the assassins to be completed.

Having been in the habit of expressing his will very briefly in his
lifetime, it is not surprising that he should have left at his death a
will, so short, that it purported to say in four letters all he desired.
His last testament was comprised in the characters P. R. H. E.;
and all his property was supposed to be represented in this small
collection of capitals. The Romans affecting to be initiated in the
meaning of these initials, declared them to signify, <i>Populus Romanus
hæres est</i>, Let the Roman people be the heirs of my property. Regarding
these letters as letters of administration, the Romans possessed
themselves of all the effects of Attalus; but the will was disputed by
the next of kin, one Aristonicus, a natural brother, whose claim to
succeed, as a member of the testator's line, was stifled by a rope, with
which the unfortunate claimant was cruelly <a name="strangled" id="strangled"></a>strangled.<br /><br /></p>

<p><br /><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Pergamus became a Roman province under the name of Asia
Proper&mdash;a species of appropriation which there was nothing to justify.</p>

<p>Rome was now in the position of a man who had outgrown his
strength, or rather of an adult still wearing the clothes of its infancy.
Its measures had been adapted to a social body which had since spread
itself in all directions, while the constitution, with which it was
clothed, had not been extended to the new growth; and the extreme
points of the Republic were therefore reduced to all sorts of extremities.
The people at large had become so miserably poor, that they were
easily bribed to become the tools of their own further abasement; and
they were not only ready to sell themselves for a mere nothing, but to
lend themselves to almost anything.</p>

<p>The tribuneship, which had been originally a purely popular institution,
had changed, or rather lost, its character. Instead of being
stationed outside the entrance of the Senate House, to prevent the door
from being opened to abuse, the Tribunes were, by a law of C. Atinius,
constituted <i>ex-officio</i> members of that aristocratic body. The design of
the tribuneship was to insure to the people a certain number of friends
invested with high authority; but the people were eventually anxious
to be saved from their friends&mdash;a result that is by no means rare in
ancient or modern history. As the bitterest vinegar can be made from
the most generous wine, the sharpest of despots is often created out of
the blandest of demagogues.</p>

<p>So great had the power of the Tribunes become, and so much had it
been abused, that even the Senate grew jealous of it; and a law was
enacted to bring the tribuneship under the operation of signs and
omens. These were interpreted by the Augurs, who of course had the
power of reading in the lightning, and hearing in the reports of the
thunder, whatever it suited their purpose to circulate.</p>

<p>Aristocracy had lost its exclusive privileges; but these had only
become more objectionable by being spread over a larger surface; for
they were now extended to a certain portion of the plebeians, who went
by the name of <i>novi homines</i>, or upstarts. These were distinguished
from the Nobiles, or, to speak shortly, the nobs, who enjoyed the right
of having the images of their ancestors in wax; but this <i>jus imaginum</i>,
as it was termed, conferred only an imaginary dignity. There was no
legal privilege attached to the sort of nobility above described; but
those persons who were qualified by the possession of the waxen forms
of their fathers, were looked upon as men making in society a highly
respectable figure.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the liberty which is declared by republicans to be
inseparable from the Republican form of Government, laws were passed
to restrain the liberty of private action in the days of the Roman
Commonwealth. By the Orchian law, made in the year of the city
572 (<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 181), the number of guests that might sit down to dinner
was limited: and as a further illustration of republican freedom, it may
be mentioned that the entertainer was obliged to keep open his doors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>,
so that all who were freely-and-easily inclined might enter his house to
see that the law was complied with. Twenty years later, it was
decreed by the law of Fannius, that no entertainment should cost more
than one hundred asses, or six shillings and five-pence farthing, on high
days and holidays; on ten other days in the month, the meal was not
to exceed thirty asses, or one and eleven-pence farthing; but on ordinary
occasions seven-pence farthing was the figure to which even the richest
man was to limit the cost of his dinner. The law not only interfered
with the bill of expenses, but with the bill of fare; and, under the
Consulship of M. Scaurus, the dormouse was excluded from the dinner-table
as an enervating luxury. Vegetables were allowed to any extent,
and bread might be eaten at&mdash;or even beyond&mdash;discretion.</p>

<p>To such a ridiculous extent did the Romans carry their interference
with the private expenditure of each other, that when Crassus and Cn.
Demetrius were Censors, they endeavoured in the most absurd manner
to damage each other's popularity. Demetrius publicly charged
Crassus with having been guilty of extravagance for going into mourning
on the death of a favourite fish; and Crassus retorted by declaring that
Demetrius had lost three wives without exhibiting signs of mourning
for any one of them.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>

<h2><br /><br />CHAPTER THE TWENTY-THIRD</h2>

<h3>THE GRACCHI AND THEIR MOTHER. RISE AND FALL OF TIBERIUS<br />
AND CAIUS GRACCHUS.<br /><br /></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A people</span> trained to live chiefly on spoils taken from others must be
continually spoiling itself for any peaceful occupation; and those whose
chief support is the sword, must be always destroying the food they live
upon. When foreign means are exhausted, it becomes necessary to
look at home, and those who have existed by robbing strangers, are no
sooner deprived of their external sources of support, than they begin to
rob each other. Such was the order&mdash;or rather the disorder&mdash;of things
in Rome, where wealth had got into the hands of the few, and the social
fabric, like a building too heavy at the top, was in immediate danger of
a downfall. There were large classes of persons who were assured that
they were perfectly free; but, though enjoying the freedom of air itself,
they found in it no element of comfort, when they had nothing more
substantial than the air to live upon. Deprived of every inch of land, there
was but a flatulent sort of satisfaction in the enjoyment of the atmosphere,
nor could the most long-winded of orators impress the people with
the idea that life could be maintained by simply imbibing the breath of
liberty. They were informed that they were the lords of the earth;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
but this mockery of respect was simply insulting the emptiness of their
mouths by a scarcely less empty title. The plebeians were like a
number of ciphers without a preliminary figure, and, though possessing
all the materials of strength in their vast body, were powerless until a
head could be found for them. This at length appeared in the person
of Tib. Sempronius Gracchus, the grandson of the elder Scipio, and as
two heads are said to be better than one, Tib. united his brother Caius
with him in the office of leader to the great plebeian movement.</p>

<p>The elder Gracchus had been tutored by his mother Cornelia&mdash;one
of the earliest members of the ancient and honourable order of blue-stockings.
She had superintended the education of her children, and
had personally tutored them in eloquence; an art of which the female
tongue is peculiarly capable. Her own house was the resort of some of
the first philosophers of the day, who, like many modern philosophers,
were thoroughly impressed with the idea that the way to penetrate the
youthful mind, is to continue for ever boring it. In this manner the
understandings of the young Gracchi had been thoroughly drilled, and
the treasures of science had been admitted at so many apertures, that
the only fear was lest the treasures, through some of the numerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
openings by which they had got into the mind, might find their way
out <a name="again" id="again"></a>again.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">The Mother of the Gracchi.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />Tib. had already won some reputation in Spain, and was returning
home, when he saw the Etrurian estates of the wealthy being cultivated
by foreign slaves in chains, whose bonds not only bore the seal of
degradation for themselves, but were the means of fettering native
industry. These slaves were housed and huddled together in places
called Ergastula, which were literally workhouses, but practically,
prisons. They are said to have been built under-ground in the shape
of vaults; but, in giving this account of their construction, there has
perhaps been some misconstruction on the part of Columella, who is the
chief authority for the statement.</p>

<p>We must now return to Tib. Gracchus, who had, by this time,
returned to Rome, and had formed the noble resolution of remedying
abuses, though he knew that loud abuse of himself would be the
inevitable consequence. He had seen that the aristocracy had got
possession of nearly all the land, allowing the plebeians to have no share
in it, except the ploughshare, and even this was often denied them by
the employment of slaves instead of the free agricultural labourer.
Tib. was learned in the law, and recollected the existence in the books
of the old statute of Licinius, which had fallen into disuse, and the
renewal of which he thought might put new life into the plebeian body.
By this law, no one was allowed to occupy more than 500 jugera&mdash;about
330 English acres&mdash;of the land of the state; but the state of the
land exhibited a very different distribution of the public property.</p>

<p>The poorer occupants of the soil had been compelled by their necessities
to sell to the richer, and Tiberius made the popular but scarcely
honest proposal, that those who had bought should give back to those
who had sold&mdash;a suggestion which was hailed by the masses as the
happy inspiration of a patriot. The idea was simple enough, and if
simplicity is an element of grandeur, the notion was so far a great one;
though, as it is based on the principle, that when a man has sold
everything he possesses, the purchaser or the possessor should hand
the property back to the original vendor, the project is not well
adapted to business purposes. The suggestion was, however, one which
enabled a patriot to go to the country with a "cry," and though the end
proposed was laudable enough, the means, which involved an interference
with the means of the wealthy, could not command the general
approval. It is true that much of the property had been unfairly
obtained, and that much more was held in illegal quantities; but some
had been the subject of regular sale, and the general confiscation
proposed was but a Procrustean measure of justice.</p>

<p>The plan was of course opposed, and the term of "selfish aristocrat"
was liberally, or illiberally&mdash;for they are unfortunately too much alike,
sometimes, in their political sense&mdash;bestowed on every one who did his
utmost to protect what the law had allowed him to regard for years as
his own property. Common sense, however, began so far to prevail over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
clamour, that the proposal of Tib. Gracchus was modified to some
extent, and the distribution of the surplus land was confided to a
permanent commission of three men, who were called the Triumviri. In
order to give something like consistency to the measure, it provided,
that the land which had been taken away from its old possessors should
not be sold by the new; and thus a sort of uniformity was observed
by robbing the former, and restricting the latter; so that the principle
of not being able to do what one likes with one's own, was affirmed in
each instance. The injustice of the whole proceeding was so palpable,
notwithstanding the "popularity" of the scheme, that a compensation
clause was introduced to indemnify those who had built houses at their
own expense upon the ground; but nothing was awarded to those who
had only built upon it their hopes of being allowed to continue in quiet
possession of the property.</p>

<p>Party feeling ran, of course, exceedingly high, or, in other words, its
proceedings were extremely low on both sides. Tib. Gracchus was
lauded by the people as the essence of everything noble, and denounced
by the patricians as the incarnation of everything contemptible. On
one side he was hailed as a patriot, and on the other side he was hooted
as a fraudulent demagogue; so that if everything that went in at one ear
went out at the other, his head must have been a thoroughfare for every
kind of vehicle of abuse and flattery. The Senate took the meanest
means of revenge, and reduced his official salary to one denarius and a
half, or about a shilling a day in English money. Tiberius, thus
curtailed of the means on which he lived, declared there was a conspiracy
against his life, and rather prematurely went into mourning for
himself, to excite the public sympathy. Putting his children into
black, he took them with him from house to house, requesting that they
might be taken in as orphans; but the public refused to be taken in by
a trick so obvious. False accusations were, however, brought against
him; and a next-door neighbour stood up in the Senate, declaring that
he had that morning observed a diadem and a scarlet robe delivered at
the back door, which proved that Tiberius intended to usurp the regal
authority. In order to obtain the weight of an official position for his
reforms, Tiberius got himself elected tribune of the people, and the apparently
inevitable effects of taking office were at once shown in his introduction
of a modified edition of the measure he had previously clamoured for.</p>

<p>The aristocratic party set every engine and every old pump at work
to throw cold water on his project, and they at length persuaded one of
his colleagues, named Octavius, who was played upon as easily as an
octave flute, to take part against him. The mode of opposition resorted
to by Gracchus was rather more effective than constitutional, for he
called upon the people to dismiss his colleague&mdash;an arrangement almost
as equitable as it would be for one judge to insist upon the dismissal of
another, who might refuse to announce himself submissively as "of the
same opinion" with his learned brother. When, however, the people
are once fairly off, in a certain or uncertain course, they seldom think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
how unfairly their precipitancy may operate. They had set their hearts
on a particular measure, and they refused to be guided by their heads;
but without deliberation, drove away every obstacle that impeded the
accomplishment of their wishes. As Octavius still held his position,
Gracchus gave notice that he had a resolution to propose, and, on the
following day, he moved the removal of his colleague. Octavius,
however, met the proposed resolution by a remarkable display of
resolution on his own part, and he declared that he should stick to
his office, notwithstanding the other's unfriendly offices. These means
having failed, Tiberius made a personal appeal to his colleague, and
pointed out to him the gracefulness of a voluntary resignation; but
Octavius, who rated himself very highly, objected altogether to
the voluntary principle. Tiberius next attempted to starve his colleague
out by sealing up the treasury; but the sealing made no impression
on Octavius, who retained his official seat until it was drawn
from under him by the mob, and he fell to the ground, between the
two stools of himself and his unscrupulous colleague. A client or
creature of the Gracchi was elected in the place of the deposed Tribune,
who had been got rid of by upsetting one of the most important forms
of the constitution&mdash;that form being no other than the bench occupied
by one of the highest officers of the government. Octavius was hurried
out among the mob, who thrust him about in every direction; but,
when it came to the push, Tiberius Gracchus endeavoured to pull him
through his difficulties. The effort was almost vain; and Octavius owed
his life to a faithful slave, who lost an eye in seeing his master through
the dangers that surrounded him. After this manifestation of the popular
opinion, no Tribune ventured to have an opinion of his own&mdash;or, if he had,
he kept it to himself, with a prudent regard to his personal safety.</p>

<p>The new bill for distributing the soil became at once the law of the
land, and the two Gracchi&mdash;Tib. and Caius&mdash;with Appius Claudius,
the father-in-law of the former, became a permanent triumvirate. This
desire of the temporary holders of power to change their tenancy at will
to a life estate, has been in all ages conspicuous. The stability of
authority is so desirable, that a fixed executive seems to be everywhere
a natural want; but the mushroom might as well seek to substitute
itself for the oak, whose roots have struck deep into the soil, as the
mere chief of a revolution might hope, without any hold on the affections
of a nation, to become the founder of a dynasty.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Tib. Gracchus canvassing.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />Tib. Gracchus, in the true spirit of a patriot by profession, proposed
limiting every power but his own, which he sought to render as extensive
as possible. When his term of office had legally expired, he
declared that the safety of the republic required his re-election, and he
accordingly forced himself on the attention of the electors as the only
desirable candidate. On the day previous to the election, he spent all the
afternoon in the mourning he had already bought, and leading his children
by the hand, he exhibited himself and them as the "un-happy family,"
in the public thoroughfares. The election had already commenced, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
following day, when the Conservative party objected to it on the ground
of illegality. The proceedings were already opened, when Tib. Gracchus
set out on a canvass, expecting that his canvass would enable him to
reach the desired point with a wet sail and flying colours. Not content
with going alone to solicit the electors, he took one of his own boys in
his hand, and he got all the mothers on his side, by introducing what
may be termed child's play into his electioneering movements. In the
afternoon, the candidate doubted whether he would go personally to the
poll, when his friends&mdash;some of them from whom he would have been
glad to have been saved&mdash;assured him that he had better go, for there
was no danger. Taking their advice, he had got as far as the area in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
front of the Capitol, when he was seized with the irresolution of an area-sneak,
and hanging about the spot, he refused to go further. A debate
was in progress among the senators, when one of them, P. Scipio Nasica,
called upon the house to come to the door, and save the republic by
sacrificing Tiberius. The whole assembly rushed upon its legs and its
crutches; some of the members seized hold of sticks, others snatched
up their clubs, and declared that the vengeance of the clubs should fall
on Tiberius. In this spirit they sallied forth, and looking for Gracchus,
they soon knocked dissension on the head, by one of those blows which
disposed of any pretensions he might have had to a crown when they
first encountered him. His brother, Caius Gracchus, fell politically with
his relative; but without resigning his office, he abandoned his post,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and he withdrew to a little place he had in the country, though neglecting
to give up his place in the <a name="triumvirate" id="triumvirate"></a>triumvirate.<br /><br /></p>

<p><br /><br />Scipio Æmilianus was on his return from Spain to Rome when he
heard of the death of his brother-in-law; and, quoting a line from
Homer, to the effect that</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:6em">
"All thus perish who such deeds perform,"</span>
</p>

<p>he declared that his relative Tib. had met with such a fate as his antecedents
warranted. Scipio at once assumed the leadership of the
Conservatives, or rather of the destructives; for their Conservatism
consisted merely in a desire to keep all they had unfairly got, while
their policy tended to break all the bonds of mutual interest and goodwill,
which can alone permanently bind <a name="society" id="society"></a>society.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Scipio Æmilianus cramming himself for a Speech after a hearty Supper.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />The plebeian party became quite as unreasonable on one side of the
question, as the patricians had been on the other; and C. Papirius
Carbo, a demagogue, who had got the place of tribune, proposed that
the people should have the right of re-electing the same person to the
tribuneship over and over again,&mdash;a suggestion designed to render his
own position permanent. Scipio Æmilianus opposed the measure to
the utmost; and after going home one night, he had no sooner finished
his supper, than he began to cram himself for a speech, with which he
contemplated coming out on the day following. He was, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
found dead in his bed; and, though probability points to apoplexy as
the cause, the historians have&mdash;without much, indeed, of evidence&mdash;returned
a verdict of Wilful Murder against C. P. Carbo. We have
no hesitation in acquitting him of this dreadful crime; but we cannot
say that we shall be able to allow him to quit these pages without a
stain on his character. It is to be regretted that the Senate had not
the courage to institute an inquiry at the time when the occurrence
took place, and when only the real facts could have been ascertained;
for such a course would have saved considerable trouble to those
chroniclers who are always ready to frame an entirely new set of
circumstances of their own, to replace those which contemporaneous
investigation has omitted to supply us with.</p>

<p>Caius Sempronius Gracchus was getting daily more tired of his
thoroughly retired life; and, being an excellent spokesman, he began to
flatter himself that the commonweal might profit by his services. He
is said to have been urged on by his brother's ghost; but there is
reason to believe that he was impelled by a more commendable spirit.
This fraternal shade is stated to have appeared to him in his dreams;
but the matters he now began to take in hand were not those which he
could afford to go to sleep over.</p>

<p>In republics, where he who is the humble servant of the people
to-day, may be, to-morrow, the people's master, talent is looked upon
with jealousy by the governing power, which, while ostensibly employing
an able instrument, may be, in fact, promoting a dangerous rival.
Thus, when the head of a nation is removable, it is reluctant to employ
the best men, lest they prove better than the head itself, and aspire to
the very highest position.</p>

<p>Where the form of government is monarchical, it is to the interest of
the ruler to avail himself of the ablest assistance he can obtain; for,
being himself irremovable, he becomes the fixed centre towards which
the glories and successes of his ministers and servants continually
gravitate.</p>

<p>It was on the principle of getting rid of a dangerous rival, that the
republican government had sent away Caius Gracchus from Rome,&mdash;where
he might have been everything&mdash;to Sardinia, where he would
almost inevitably sink to nothing. He was himself apprehensive of
this result, and he consequently returned to Rome, leaving Sardinia
without the leave of any one. His duty should have kept him abroad,
but ambition urged him home; and, in a republic, there is little to
insure the fidelity of one who, though the servant of the Government
to-day, may be its master to-morrow. Leaving the interests of his
country in Sardinia to take care of themselves, this professed patriot
came to look after his own interests in Rome, and took his talents
into the political market. He immediately stood for the tribuneship;
and though he had abandoned one post&mdash;that of Quæstor in
Sardinia&mdash;he was elected to the more important post, which might,
indeed, be termed the chief pillar of popular liberty.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Though he had, of course, solicited and obtained his high office on
purely public grounds, he at once endeavoured to use it for the gratification
of personal animosities. His first two measures were proposed
with a view to avenging his brother's death; and he sought to give
the intended new laws a retrospective effect, for the purpose of gratifying
his private enmity. He introduced a law to prevent a person
deprived by the people of any office, from being appointed to the public
service again; but this exalted patriot withdrew the bill to please his
mother. He carried various measures of more or less value, and
among them was a law for the establishment of granaries for supplying
the poor with corn at a very low price; but though this might have
been very attractive to buyers, and insured a brisk demand, it does not
seem calculated to encourage growers and sellers to such an extent that
a supply could always be relied upon. Of course, the deficiency had to
be made good from the pockets of the public; and therefore the process
amounted to little more than receiving with one hand what had been
paid by the other.</p>

<p>The privilege of purchasing cheap corn was not limited, as some<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
have supposed, to the poor; but every citizen could claim his share;
and even Piso, a Consul&mdash;though perhaps he was one of the greatly
reduced Consuls&mdash;had been shabby enough to demand the privilege.
Piso had been an opponent of the law; and Gracchus, seeing him among
the crowd receiving a bushel of the cheap grain, taunted him with his
inconsistency in taking advantage of a corn measure which he had set his
face against. The answer of Piso was sensible and just; for, said he,
"though I had a strong objection to your giving away my property,
I think I have a right to try to get my share of it." Another
of his enactments vested the right of putting a Roman citizen to death,
in the people themselves, a measure that was no doubt theoretically
attractive, though practically inconvenient. To vest in the public at
large the privilege of applying the sentences to the highest offences,
would really be giving a nation so much rope, that business would be
suspended very often, instead of the criminals.</p>

<p>Caius Gracchus next applied himself to Law Reform with considerable
zeal; but it was not so much the law itself, as those who
administered it, that required amendment. Those who held the scales of
justice, used to weigh only the gold of the suitors; and the judges were
so far impartial, that they had no bias towards any particular side, but
favoured that which was the most liberal in bribing them. Many of
the defendants had been guilty of extortion, which was a common
practice with the judges themselves; and therefore a rude sort of
honour, commonly known as honour among thieves, was not altogether
banished from the judgment-seat. Caius Gracchus, however, caused
a law to be passed, in which we trace the origin of that glorious
institution, familiarly known as "twelve men in a box," so dear to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
hearts, and sometimes, also, to the pockets of Englishmen. The law
alluded to, provided for the trial of causes by a middle class of equites
or knights, who were, literally speaking, men who could keep a horse,
and who, on the same principle adopted in modern times as to the
keepers of gigs,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> were considered to be respectable.</p>

<p>The Senators had made a practice of acquitting all criminals of their
own class, and, by acquitting themselves thus shamefully, they had
become guilty of the grossest corruption; but the equites were
frequently regardless of equity, and were found leaning with undue
leniency towards offenders of their own order. Gracchus had now
become the popular idol, but he never had an idle hour, and was
always busy in building up a reputation for himself by the construction
of works of permanent utility. He knew that general occupation is
necessary to public content, and he felt that as long as he could keep
the hands of the multitude employed on bricks and mortar, he was, in
reality, cementing his own power. This policy placed considerable
patronage at his command, and he rallied round him a crowd of contractors
and artificers, who, but for his power of giving them something
better to do, would, perhaps, have been contracting the bad habit of
political agitation, or resorting to every kind of revolutionary artifice.</p>

<p>The greatest political work of Caius was that in which he did the
least; and his legislative successes sink into insignificance by the side
of the real grandeur of his extensive failure. This was his attempt to
extend the franchise to all the Italians, and the other allies; but Rome
refused to aid him in the grand design, and determined to rivet upon
Italy those Italian irons with which Rome at a future period was
destined to burn her fingers. So popular was Caius Gracchus, that,
upon his re-election to office, the people, who could not get near
enough to the Campus Martius on account of the crowd, voted for him
from the tops of houses or unfinished buildings; and many came up
to the poll by climbing an adjacent scaffold.</p>

<p>He who would keep himself constantly sailing before the wind raised
by the breath of public applause, must be for ever on some new tack;
for no airs are more variable than those which the people are apt to
give themselves. Caius Gracchus was soon destined to discover the
fact that, amid the storms of political life, the highest point can be
safely occupied by none but the political weathercock. He had too
much rigid inflexibility to turn with every breeze; and instead of being
moved by each passing gust, he was simply dis-gusted by the vacillation
<a name="exhibited" id="exhibited"></a>exhibited.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Rash Act of Caius Gracchus.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />The aristocratic party, perceiving this, resolved to beat him with his own
weapons; and they prevailed upon M. Livius Drusus, his colleague in
the tribuneship, to outbid him by all sorts of extravagances for the prize
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
of popularity. When Gracchus proposed to distribute land among the
poor at a small fixed rental, Drusus moved, by way of amendment, that
they should have it for nothing at all; and as to the corn in the public
granaries, if Gracchus said the people ought to have it at half price,
Drusus would insist upon their right to be paid for the trouble of walking
away with it. The people, as a matter of course, followed the man who
was most profuse in his promises, rather than him who had been the
most liberal in his performances. Caius Gracchus was, in the mean
time, induced to go to Africa to mark out the ground for a new city.
The reporters of the period&mdash;who were, no doubt, in the pay of his
opponents&mdash;circulated all kinds of ill-natured stories, in which it was
alleged that the omens had been unfavourable; that the flags had been
blown down, or the pavement blown up; and that the wolves had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
eaten up every flag-staff&mdash;a thing not very easy to swallow. On his
return to Rome, from which he had been absent only seventy days,
he found Drusus amazingly popular, and every nose turned up at
himself, which induced him to recognise a general snub in the faces
of many of his old followers. He offered himself a third time for
the tribuneship, but he was at the bottom of the poll, and an election
row commenced, when an officious lictor lost, first, his fasces; secondly,
his securis&mdash;which he had done his utmost to secure; and ultimately
his life, in the scuffle. Caius Gracchus, who had mainly endeavoured
to keep the peace, knew he would be accused of breaking
it, and he accordingly ran as fast as he could; but in scaling a wall to
get into another street, he unfortunately sprained his ankle. His
friends continued to carry him until, moved by a sudden instinct of
self-preservation, they dropped an acquaintance it would have been no
longer safe to keep up, and poor Caius was left alone with a single manservant.
His pursuers being at his heels, the ex-tribune desired the
faithful attendant to stab him, and the man was too much in the habit
of obeying his master's orders to hesitate. Having respectfully run his
employer through, he found himself so terribly out of place in the world,
that, apologising for the liberty, he finished himself off with the same
dagger.</p>

<p>A reward of its weight in gold had already been offered for the head
of Caius Gracchus, when one Septimulcius, having picked it up, carried
it home, and plumbed it with lead before he took it to the authorities.
Opimius, the Consul, weighed it, and exclaiming, "Bless me! seven
pounds and a half!" threw down in exchange for the head, the same
quantity of the precious metal. His customer having gone away,
Opimius proceeded at his leisure to examine his bargain. "Well!"
said he, "I don't know that it's worth its weight in gold, but the offer
was my own, and I must make the best of it." On a minuter inspection,
he detected the trick that had been played, and though he had looked
upon Caius as somewhat leaden-headed, he at once perceived that nature
had not been the only plumber employed in this disgraceful transaction.</p>

<p>All the friends of Gracchus were cast into prison and slain; but it
was astonishing to observe how contracted his circle became when it was
known that ruin awaited every member of it. They who had been his
intimates made the sudden discovery that they had never known him at
all, and others, who had been too frequently in his company to
repudiate the acquaintance, declared that they had been grievously
mistaken in his character. Several of his radical associates joined the
aristocratic party, and his friend Carbo was so severely bantered on his
having gone over to the other side, that after trying both sides, he took
refuge in suicide as the only side left for him.</p>

<p>Rome owed much to the Gracchi; but it paid them both off in a
most unsatisfactory manner. Tiberius was an orator of such power,
that, to prevent his voice from being too loud, he took with him a
piper&mdash;paying the piper out of his own pocket&mdash;to prevent him from
pitching it too strong when he was addressing the multitude. Tiberius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Gracchus was the first orator who introduced the graces of action into
the art of public speaking; and he was in the habit of rolling, as it were,
from side to side, which gave him great sway with his audience.</p>

<p>Caius Gracchus was a man of action, rather than of words, and was
the first to divide distance into portions of one thousand paces, each of
which he called a mile, and which was one of his really useful measures.
He was also the inventor of milestones, and of those stations for
awkward equestrians, which enabled many to ride the high horse, who
would otherwise have been placed on their own humble footing.</p>

<p>The two Gracchi owed, no doubt, to the teaching of their mother,
much of their success&mdash;if, at least, that can be called success which ended
in the violent death of both of them. Cornelia was, however, a little
too much addicted to making prodigies of her sons; and it is said of her,
that, on one occasion, when receiving a visit from a Campanian lady,
who came to display her jewels, the mother of the Gracchi, having
privately sent for the children, exclaimed, as they stole gently in with
their nurse, "These are my jewels: what do you think of them?" So
maudlin was her maternal sensibility, that she never spoke of her sons
without tears, which were always responded to by the infants themselves,
with sympathetic, but uncomfortable, moisture. Nothing, however,
can damp parental love; and, to a fond mother's feelings,
childhood has no unpleasant features; though it is different to him who,
if approaching them at all, prefers looking at them in a drier <a name="aspect" id="aspect"></a>aspect.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br />CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FOURTH.</h2>

<h3>THE JUGURTHINE WAR. WAR AGAINST THE CIMBRI AND TEUTONI.<br /><br /></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Rome had been making the numerous conquests already
described, self-conquest&mdash;the most important conquest of all&mdash;had been
altogether lost sight of, and she had failed in obtaining the victory
over her own vices. Though she possessed, nominally, a constituted
body of rulers, money was actually the governing power; and so
debasing is its influence, that it is more fatal to the liberty of a people
to be ruled with a rod of gold, than with a rod of iron. No consideration
but pecuniary consideration had any weight, corruption presided
in the courts of law, the people were bought by the Senate, and the
Senate sold the people. In the army there was a system of shameless
plunder on the part of the commanders, and the soldiers followed their
leaders with avidity.</p>

<p>Numidia had, since the death of Masinissa, been ruled over by his
son Micipsa, who, by his will, put his kingdom, as it were, into commission,
by giving it to his two sons, Hiempsal and Adherbal, conjointly
with a lad whom he had adopted, and whose name was Jugurtha.
Jugurtha was a person of excellent manners and genteel address, an
excellent horseman, the first to strike the lion<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> in the field, and himself
a lion much run after in society.</p>

<p>On the death of Micipsa, when the three rulers came to the throne
of Numidia, they found the accommodation rather insufficient, and
Jugurtha insolently threw himself down in the middle of it. By this
act the two sons of Micipsa were practically set aside, and Jugurtha
assumed that in himself alone the monarchy was centered. His next
act was to propose the abolition of the acts of the last five years of
Micipsa's reign, declaring that they ought all to be dotted out, on the
ground of the old man's dotage. Hiempsal, with a touch of sarcasm,
assented to the proposal, observing&mdash;"We shall then get rid of you, as
your adoption was an act performed within the prescribed period."
This attempt to be funny was a serious matter to Hiempsal, for Jugurtha
caused the would-be wag to be murdered in the palace.</p>

<p>After this instance of sharp practice, on the part of Jugurtha,
Adherbal began to tremble in his shoes lest he might be made to walk
in his brother's footsteps. This fear was so nearly on the point of
being realised, that Adherbal took to flight, and ran all the way to
Rome, to ask for aid; upon which a commission of inquiry, consisting
of ten members, was despatched to Numidia.</p>

<p>To refer any matter to a commission, has always been considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
equivalent to laying it permanently on the shelf; and such might have
been the result of the quarrel of the Numidian princes, had it not been
for the fact that Jugurtha had settled the dispute in his own way,
before the commissioners had even opened their inquiry. By the time
they had arrived on the spot to which they had been sent, they found
one of the parties dead, and the other in possession of all that he
desired. Jugurtha was, of course, the survivor in this affair; and when
the ambassadors, on their arrival, expressed their astonishment at their
services having been dispensed with, he, by offering them something for
their trouble, sent them home fully and shame-fully satisfied.</p>

<p>Every spark of honour was not, however, extinct in Rome; for the
tribune, C. Memmius, who had not received, or, indeed, had not been
offered, any of Jugurtha's gold, became virtuously indignant at the disgraceful
harvest made by the ten commissioners. His agitation was so far
successful, that war was declared, and the Consul, L. Calpurnius Bestia,
with his legate, M. Æmilius Scaurus, were sent to invade Africa.
Bestia immediately made the best bargain he could for himself, by concluding
a peace with Jugurtha, on certain terms, for which the Roman
Consul's own terms were most exorbitant. He and his legate, Scaurus,
accepted a nominal surrender of all Jugurtha's tents, horses, and
elephants; but he was allowed to reserve nearly the whole of his canvas
booths and his menagerie.</p>

<p>When the tribune Memmius heard of the venality of the ambassadors,
and of the money they had corruptly made by their services abroad,
he, whose duties kept him at home, became more indignant than ever.
He denounced, in abusive language, the abuse of which they had been
guilty, and succeeded at last in carrying a motion that Jugurtha should
appear to answer for his offences of bribery and corruption before the
Senate. The summons was carried to Africa, by the stern and incorruptible
Cassius, who refused every offer of cash, and insisted on the
personal appearance of Jugurtha at the time and place appointed. The
artful Numidian came with a very small retinue and a very long purse;
for he knew that in meeting such an antagonist as Rome, he should not
have to draw the steel from the scabbard, but the gold from the
treasury. He threw purses in all directions; and so extensive was his
bribery, that the criminals who had accepted his money were a strong
majority over the few who were qualified, by not having participated in
the offence, to sit in judgment over it. Memmius, who had seen none of
Jugurtha's gold, insisted on his giving up the names of those who had
received it; but there was such a vehement and general shout of "No,"
that any further inquiry as to who were the culprits, would have been
quite superfluous.</p>

<p>The only punishment the Senate ventured to inflict upon Jugurtha,
was a sentence of banishment; and it was indeed quite natural that the
dishonourable members should have been glad to send speedily out of
the way the principal witness to their own turpitude. As Jugurtha
quitted Rome, he expressed his disgust at her venality, in a sentiment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
which came with but an ill grace from an accomplice in her infamy.
"Oh!" he exclaimed, with an air of affected horror, "Oh! thou
venal city; thou wouldst sell thyself to perdition, if thou couldst only
find a purchaser!" The exact point at which this claptrap was uttered,
who was at hand to hear it, and supposing the reporters to have been
present, whether they proceeded to take it down, are points which the
historians have not shown any disposition to look into.</p>

<p>After the retirement of the only witness, the inquiry into the
bribery cases was prosecuted with considerable vigour. Scaurus, who
had been one of the chief delinquents, attempted to expiate his own
faults by getting himself appointed a member of the committee, and
passing as severe sentences as he could upon his fellow criminals.</p>

<p>War with Jugurtha was again declared; for it was one of the
most prolific sources of a profitable job to those in power. The Consul,
Spurius Posthumius Albinus, was despatched with an army to Africa;
but he soon came home, like his predecessors, with a large fortune,
which seemed to be the kind of fortune of war that attended all who
went to fight against Numidia. He left the army under the guidance
of his brother Aulus, who, with his officers, were easily bribed into
accepting any terms, provided they were of a pecuniary nature, that
Jugurtha proposed to them. The Senate, however, refused to ratify
the dishonourable peace concluded by Aulus; and thus, by the somewhat
dishonest process of repudiating the acts of an authorised agent,
Rome was again free to make a further property of the Numidian
sovereign. At last, however, the affair was placed in honourable hands,
by the appointment of Metellus (Q. C.) to the command of the army.
His probity placed him far above any bribe that Jugurtha could offer;
and though it is a maxim with many, that every man has his price, it
may be said of Metellus that his moral standard was too high for any
pecuniary standard to be applied to it.</p>

<p>With the generosity of true genius, Metellus selected as his legate
a man capable of sharing with himself any of the honours that might
be gained in the wars about to be undertaken. This man was Caius
Marius, who had been, in early life, a labourer; but, while working
with the spade, he felt sure that something would eventually turn up
in his favour. He had served as a common soldier, but proved himself
no common man; and he rose, step by step, to a highly respectable
position. Vanity, however, was one of his weak points, and he fell into
the hands of an old Syrian fortune-teller, who resorted to all sorts of
tricks to persuade him that he was destined for the highest honours.
He mentioned his aspirations to Metellus, and hinted at the possibility
of his obtaining the Consulship; but his superior officer burst into a
loud laugh, which, instead of putting Marius out of conceit, put him
further into it. He proceeded to Rome, and, by a series of popular
speeches, in which he promised everything to the people, he, of course,
gained their suffrages. Having obtained the Consulship, he was despatched
to finish the war against Jugurtha; but Metellus, having first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
pretended that there was nothing more to be done, for that he had
settled the whole business himself, resigned his post to Marius.</p>

<p>Peace had indeed been already concluded with Jugurtha; but Rome,
with its habitual want of faith, re-opened the war, which terminated at
last in Jugurtha's being taken prisoner. He was drawn behind the
chariot of Marius&mdash;a situation little less exalted than being tied to a
cart's tail, and in that position received the pelting of a pitiless storm of
mud from the congenial hands of a cowardly populace. Being thrown
into a damp dungeon, he&mdash;as we are told by the grave historians&mdash;still
preserved his wit; for he exclaimed, as he entered his prison, "By
Hercules, what a cold bath!"&mdash;a touch of humour which seems to us
remarkable for neither breadth, point, nor neatness. When, however,
we consider the moisture of the circumstances under which he was
placed, we cannot be surprised that he should have failed in an attempt
at dry humour.</p>

<p>The war with Jugurtha was no sooner at an end, than Rome found
herself threatened by the swords of half-a-dozen different foes; and, in
default of being able to cut herself into six, for the purpose of dividing
her strength, she seemed in danger of such a cutting-up at the hands
of her enemies. It would be a tedious task to unravel the excessive
tangle into which the threads of history are thrown by the windings of
those numerous lines of barbarians who kept themselves suspended
over Rome at about this period. The Cimbri, a Celtic race, entered
into an alliance with the Teutoni&mdash;a German band&mdash;and threw themselves
upon Gaul; which was unable to throw them off again. They
encountered the Consul, M. Junius Silanus, to whom they applied for a
country to be assigned to them; but, as this modest request could not
be attended to, they set upon Silanus, and gave him a sound beating.
At length the Consul, Q. Servilius C&#339;pio, offered to meet the difficulty,
and approached the Rhone, but the Cimbri cut to pieces 80,000 soldiers
and 40,000 camp followers; at least, if we are to believe the authorities,
who are always ready to mince men, though never mincing matters.
C&#339;pio&mdash;according to the same authentic accounts&mdash;was glad to make
his escape across the Rhone with a handful of men, and the term,
"handful" is in this instance not misapplied; for as the number is said
to have been exactly ten, he might have easily told them off on his fingers.
As if to show that they had not been actuated by mercenary motives,
the Cimbri threw into the river the whole of their booty; and, not
satisfied with spoiling the foe, they proceeded to spoil the property taken
in battle.</p>

<p>It says little to the credit of Rome that her dangers seemed to
damp the ambition of her citizens, and no one evinced an anxiety for
the perilous honours of the Consulship. Those among the aristocracy
who claimed a sort of prescriptive right to the government in times
when there was everything to be got, now that there was a prospect of
everything being lost, shrunk from the responsibility of a high position.
The plebeian, Marius, was declared to be the only man for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
situation; and, instead of being obliged to solicit the Consulship, it
was thrust upon him even before he had returned from Africa.</p>

<p>His first care was to get together an army capable of bearing the
fatigues of a military life, in preference to those who were only fit to
support its gaudy trappings. He enlisted large numbers of working
men, and tested their strength by putting into their hands a spade
before he entrusted them with a sword, subjecting them to all sorts of
privations, and putting them even upon reduced rations&mdash;an experiment
that was by no means rational. Many of the soldiers, who, under a
generous diet, would have become strong healthy men, dwindled to
mere skeletons, and many of the recruits were reduced so low that their
strength was past recruiting. Those who were able to stand against
the fatigue, were hardy enough to stand against anything; and, in
order to give them the benefit of a lengthy training, he refused to
accept battle until a convenient opportunity. He allowed the Teutoni
to pass his camp, and, as they did so, they inquired tauntingly if there
were any messages or parcels for Rome, as they&mdash;the Teutoni&mdash;were
on their journey thither. Marius pursued them to Aquæ Sextiæ&mdash;now
Aix&mdash;and purposely pitched his camp in such a place, that water could
not be obtained without a fight for it. Every soldier who went down
to the river was obliged to draw his sword as he drew the water he
required, and, while he fought with one hand, defended himself as well
as he could with a bucket in the other. The Teutoni were completely
defeated, and rushed, for safety, to their wagons; but all who remained
in the rear, together with many who had got into the van, were cut
to pieces.</p>

<p>Marius had no sooner disposed of the Teutoni, than he heard that
the Cimbri were pouring themselves all over the plains of Lombardy;
and, proceeding to meet them, he threatened to "turn their bones into
whitening for the fields," a menace that proves the practice of bone manuring
to be an agricultural process of great antiquity. He drew up his
army near Verona, at a place called the Campi Raudii, and found the
front ranks of the Cimbri linked together by chains,&mdash;an arrangement
adopted, probably, to prevent their running away, and making them
feel bound to stand against the enemy. Marius, with considerable
tact, got into such a position that the sun got into their eyes, and the
wind blew their noses. Unable to look their danger in the face, they
were sent winking and sneezing to destruction.</p>

<p>Marius celebrated the success of the day in a magnificent triumph,
and paraded, among his trophies, a Cimbric king of such a gigantic
height, that, notwithstanding his humiliating position, everybody looked
up to him.</p>

<p>For the sixth time the consulship was bestowed on Marius, though not
without a vast amount of bribery on the part of the successful candidate,
who, while he corrupted the electors with one hand, raised a temple to
Virtue and Honour with the other. He had now become so inflated with
vanity, that he came swelling into the Senate in his triumphal robes; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
he was so coldly received, that he pretended he had forgotten to change
his dress, though his astonishment was as clearly put on as his objectionable
attire. He caused to be engraved upon his buckler the image
of a Gaul pulling out his tongue; an allegory rather difficult to comprehend,
except by adopting the somewhat vulgar reading, that the design
was emblematical of the fact that, after the victory of Marius, the Gaul
might as well pull out his tongue at once, as there could be no chance
of his giving a licking to the Romans.</p>

<p>Marius was so popular, that he was acknowledged as the third
founder of Rome; Romulus, Camillus, and himself being figuratively
regarded as so many bricks that the city had been built upon.</p>

<p>Success had rendered Marius so arrogant, that he committed many
illegal acts, declaring that, amid the clashing of the swords of war, the
silent motion of the sword of justice could neither be heard nor attended
to. His morbid appetite for mob popularity caused him to enter
into a disgraceful alliance with an unprincipled demagogue, named
L. Appuleius Saturninus, whose performances equalled his promises;
but he always promised one thing, and performed another. He adopted
the extremely liberal side in politics, and proposed, among other liberal
measures, that every member of the Senate should bind himself by an
oath to support some very liberal law for dealing with property, by
taking it from those who had it, and giving it to those who were ready
to take it. This friend of freedom suggested, further, that every senator
attempting to exercise a free will, should pay a heavy penalty. One of
the aristocratic party having ventured on proposing an amendment, was
driven from the Senate by a shower of missiles. Another having
suggested that he heard thunder&mdash;a sign at which the Assembly should
have broken up&mdash;was told that there would probably be some hail, with
hail-stones of real stone, if he opposed the project of Saturninus. Marius
had the courage to declare that he would never take the degrading oath;
Metellus seconded his resolution; and the whole Senate, with one
voice&mdash;which turned out, ultimately, to be <i>vox et præterea nihil</i>&mdash;swore
that they would never swear to what the people had dared to demand
of them. Notwithstanding this spirited proposition, Marius had not
sufficient bravery to brave the popular clamour, and his courage had
died away before five days had expired. Having called a special
meeting of the Senate, he intimated that second thoughts were sometimes
best, and that, after his first thought, there had occurred to him a
second, which he proposed that they should place upon their minutes.
He concluded by intimating that he had been pelted in public for the part
he had taken, and, as the people were determined, apparently, on having
their fling, there was little use in opposing them. He declared his attachment
to his native soil; and, though he had always kept it in his eye,
he objected to its being thrown in his face by his own countrymen.
He finished by proposing that the oath should be taken, with a mental
reservation that it should not be kept&mdash;a disgraceful compromise
between cowardice and conscience, which the Senate without hesitation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
assented to. There was, after this, so little disposition to freedom
among the members, that Metellus Numidicus was the only one who
held out; and he, instead of remaining to battle with the abuse, preferred
sneaking away from it into voluntary exile.</p>

<p>Saturninus not only put himself up for the tribuneship a third time,
but endeavoured to get the Consulship for one Servilius Glaucia; and
these noisy demagogues&mdash;by way of guiding the people in their choice&mdash;coolly
murdered C. Memmius, who had started as an opposition
candidate.</p>

<p>Marius now began to perceive that he had connected himself with a
disreputable set, and finding his popularity on the wane, he repudiated
his new political allies as suddenly as he had joined with them. He
drove Saturninus to the Capitol, where, being without provisions, the
demagogue found himself at last driven to an unprovisional surrender.
Saturninus, Glaucia, and others were put to death by the command of
Marius, who thus regained the good opinion of the people, though he
had, in fact, simply trampled under foot, when down, those whom he
had taken by the hand when they were uppermost. Having so far
reinstated himself in the favour of the public, Marius retired into
private life; and it was time that he should do so, while he had yet
a certain amount of popularity left to fall back upon.</p>

<p>Law Reform, and the extension of the franchise, had now become
the two great questions of the day; for the tribunals were courts of
in-justice, and the Italians thought that as much weight ought to be
allowed to the Italic as to the Roman character. It was the policy of
the Senate to purchase popularity at almost any price, and the members
were ready to outbid each other by the most extravagant offers, for the
object of their ignoble competition. Among the boldest of the bidders
was M. Livius Drusus, the son of old Drusus&mdash;the colleague of Gracchus&mdash;who
seems to have inherited his father's propensity for sacrificing all
his principle, in order to convert it into political capital. Young Drusus
is said to have been a remarkable man, because, when Quæstor in Asia,
he dispensed with the insignia of office, preferring to depend upon his
own personal bearing, and, perhaps, wishing to save the cost of those
externals which, sometimes, take from the public functionary quite as
much in the way of emolument, as they bring him in the way of dignity.
He had been elected to the Tribuneship, and in that capacity he did
everything he could to catch the breath of popular applause, which often
sullies the brightness of the object that seeks to reflect the evanescent
vapour.</p>

<p>One of the principal propositions of M. Livius Drusus was, that the
judges should be liable to be brought to trial themselves, for their mode
of conducting the trials of others. This attempt to undermine the
independence of the judicial order, was shown to be so fatal to the
administration of justice, that the people, who, after all, require only to
be convinced of what is right in order to take the right direction, repudiated
the proposal which Drusus had intended to be the means of misleading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
them, and obtaining for himself&mdash;under false pretences&mdash;a little
additional popularity. It was pointed out to them, that a judge who felt
every trial at which he was presiding to be his own, and who would be
always divided between the calm demands of justice on one hand, and
the unreasoning voice of public clamour on the other, would feel himself
exposed to a pressure that would prevent him from maintaining an upright
position. Notwithstanding his failure in this instance, M. Livius
Drusus made himself the champion of the movement, and opened his
house every evening, to give political advice gratis to all who were
desirous of consulting him. He was engaged in this manner during
one of his evenings at home, when he was suddenly stabbed by a shoe-maker's
knife; and though the assassin was never discovered, the blow
was supposed to have been connived at by some persons who had
persuaded the cobbler to risk his awl in the dangerous effort. As a
Roman could never die without a claptrap in his mouth, Drusus was of
course prepared with a neat speech on the melancholy occasion.
Having ejaculated, "Oh! thou ungrateful Republic, thou hast never
lost a more devoted son!" he arranged his toga in becoming folds, and
bowing to circumstances&mdash;bowing, perhaps, to the audience as well&mdash;he
gracefully <a name="expired" id="expired"></a>expired.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<span class="caption">Drusus is stabbed, and expires gracefully.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br /><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
The Italians, being deprived of the support of Drusus, were more
than ever oppressed, and the multitude, whom it is customary to
regard as synonymous with the liberal party, became vehement in
denouncing the idea of allowing an equality of rights to all classes of
Roman subjects. The Italians, therefore, came to the resolution, that if
Rome was not to exist for them, it should not exist at all; but that they
would either bring the city to the ground, or raise themselves from the
dust to which injustice had lowered them. Several of the Italian
nations formed themselves into a league, but never did a league go to
such lengths as the one in question; for some of its members murdered
the prætor, Servilius C&#339;pio, and his legate, who attended a meeting in
the hope of conciliation at the Theatre of Asculum.</p>

<p>The next step of the Italians was to start a republic of their own,
under the name of Italica; and by way of giving it an imposing appearance,
it was to have a senate five hundred strong&mdash;though in a deliberative
assembly numbers are not so much an element of strength as of
weakness. It was to have two annual consuls, and no less than twelve
prætors; it being perhaps the policy of the framers of the constitution
to have plenty of patronage to tempt adherents to the new government.
The two consuls first appointed were Silo Popædius, a Marsian, and
C. Papius Mutilus, a Samnite, who took the field with great vigour,
but took little else in the first instance; for Silo fell in the fight, though
Mutilus, whose army was terribly mutilated, obtained some success in
Campania.</p>

<p>Though the Italians had commenced their operations as fast friends,
they loosened considerably in their friendship as the war advanced, and
made separate treaties of peace, by which Rome was enabled to deal
with them piecemeal, instead of being compelled to stand against their
united efforts. The Samnites evinced their old obstinacy, and waited,
as usual, to be cut to pieces, before they abandoned the hope of holding
together. When the sword had been busy among them for three years,
there remained still a mass of sufficient importance to induce the
Romans to offer the franchise to all who would lay down their arms;
and of this proposal the Samnites at last reluctantly availed themselves.</p>

<p>Rome having acquired a large accession of new citizens, was puzzled
to determine what to do with them. Had they been distributed amongst
the thirty-five country tribes, the old members would have been
swamped by the new, and the latter were, therefore, formed into&mdash;some
say six, some say eight, and some say fifteen separate bodies. Such is
the disagreement of the learned doctors on this head, that we cannot put
confidence in one without discrediting two; and we consequently take
the more impartial course of believing none of them. So great is the
discrepancy of the authorities on nearly every point, that, for the
sake of history, we can only hope they do not go for their facts to
the same sources which have supplied their figures. It is true that
they usually profess to deal with round numbers alone; and perhaps if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
every number employed were literally round, it would represent the
sum of what is known with certainty on the subjects that are spoken of.</p>

<p>The fact, however, is indisputable, that, in the times to which our
history relates, the weaker states were the prey of the stronger,&mdash;might
overcame right; and the only mode by which a small society could save
itself from destruction by one power, was by the sale of its independence
to another. Those places which were incompetent to practise the noble
art of self-defence, could only obtain protection against violence on the
right hand, by submitting to robbery on the left; and the Romans,
who were usually appealed to for aid, always plentifully helped themselves
at the cost of those by whom their help was required.</p>

<p>By the foreign policy of Rome, ambassadors were always planted in
all places of importance, to interfere in the quarrels between nations
and their kings; and the ambassadors took care, by fomenting quarrels,
that there should be no lack of material for their diplomacy. The cost
of intervention fell heavily on those upon whom it was bestowed, but it
eventually helped to ruin Rome itself; for neglect of one's own affairs
is the inevitable consequence of interfering with the affairs of one's
neighbours. The professed object of this meddling on the part of the
great republic, was to give to other states the benefit of freedom.
There is, however, no slavery more abject than that which induces a
nation to accept a foreign, instead of a domestic, tyranny. Those who
are willing to import their independence from abroad, will never find it
flourish at home; and there is not a more melancholy object&mdash;as
recent events have proved&mdash;than a transplanted tree of liberty.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br />CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIFTH.</h2>

<h3>MITHRIDATES, SULLA, MARIUS, CINNA, ET CÆTERA.<br /><br /></h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 310px;">
<img src="images/i_p0257.png" width="310" height="400" alt="" title="" />
</div>


<p><span style="margin-left:-3em" class="smcap">ollowing</span> the order of dates,
we come to Mithridates, the
son of old Mithridates the
Fifth, surnamed Eupator, who
had been a fast ally of Rome;
but his son, who was much
faster in another sense, soon
came to hostilities.</p>

<p>The birth of young Mithridates
had been, according
to Justin,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> signalised by the
appearance of a wondrous
comet, which was, probably, an
idle tale; but those whose eyes
are always strained
towards a rising
sun, are liable to
be dazzled by all
sorts of illusory
visions.</p>

<p>If the comet was
to have brought
prosperity to Mithridates,
the consignment
must have
been dropped on the
way, inasmuch as
none of it reached the young prince, whose early years were passed in hot
water; for he was in one continual perspiration, caused by the constant
discovery that his life was in danger. His grandmother, Laodice, had
killed five of her children, when young Mithridates, fearing that infanticide
might run in the family, resorted to matricide, as an alternative
for checking the fearful disease, and, according to Appian,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> murdered
his mother. It is said that his guardians did their utmost to get rid
of him, by encouraging him in all sorts of dangerous games;&mdash;that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
gave him weapons for playthings, and that one of his toys was a real
sword, with which the child might have accidentally cut the slender
thread of his own existence.</p>

<p>They mounted him, also, upon the highest horses that could be
found, which was the height of cruelty; but though the animals often
kicked and hurled the youngster from his seat, fortune always decided
the throw in his favour. He soon acquired such skill, that he was deep
enough to meet the most fearful amount of plunging; and when placed
upon a determined jibber, he could always back out of his danger.
Though the horses given him to ride were quite unbroken, his neck
remained entire; and he at length became such an excellent horseman,
that he could travel on horseback&mdash;according to Polybius&mdash;125 miles a
day, a length to which we are not prepared to go with the ancient
historian. Young Mithridates, going at full gallop, for several successive
hours, presents a spirited picture to the mind's eye, but duty compels us
to pull him up at the turnpike of truth; for we can allow no evasion
of the important trust of history.</p>

<p>Among his other accomplishments, it is said that he could hurl the
javelin to such a distance, that the enthusiasm of the spectators would
be roused to the utmost pitch; but we are obliged to add, that his power
in throwing the spear was not equal to that of the chroniclers in
throwing the hatchet.</p>

<p>His guardians having failed to kill him by physical force, attempted
to do so by the force of physic, and were continually giving him poisonous
drugs, which, though exceedingly unpleasant, he was not nice
enough to reject, for he had the bad taste to swallow them. They put
him through a course of hen-bane, but he was now no chicken, and had
learnt to neutralise the effects of the bane by a powerful antidote. So
admirably did the latter answer its object, that he could swallow arsenic
by the drachm without a scruple, and his inside was rendered thoroughly
poison-proof, though there is an utter absence of historical proof to
support the statement.</p>

<p>In order to harden himself externally, as well as internally, we are
informed that he would lie at night in the open air; but we do not
believe he was any more hardened by lying than those who make
the statement. He would trust to the chase for a dinner, and he was
often very hard run for a meal, which he sometimes sought by a contest
with a wild beast: and the question then was, whether the latter was to
be cooked, or Mithridates himself done for.</p>

<p>The excitement of an encounter with some ferocious animal furnished
the continual source of a <i>sauce piquante</i> to what he took to eat, which
formed food for his courage as well as for his appetite. He was well
versed in physics, which he was continually imbibing at the hands of his
enemies, and, in accordance with the saying <i>fas est ab hoste doceri</i>, he
turned the dosing to good account by studying the power of antidotes.
He became a master of languages, and taught himself; so that he was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
in fact, his own master and his own pupil. His object appears to have
been to save the trouble and expense of diplomatic agents, by qualifying
himself to talk with all foreign ambassadors, and to prevent the
chance of matters being misinterpreted through the mouth of an
interpreter.</p>

<p>Those historians who have built up a considerable fabric on inconsiderable
grounds, do not hesitate to add to their fabrications another
story, by describing Mithridates as a giant in growth, and as a lad so
tall that he might have overlooked an ordinary ladder.</p>

<p>Such had been the education and pursuits of the young man whom
we find occupying the throne of Pontus, and interfering in the affairs of
Cappadocia, to which he undertook to supply a king, from his own
family, whenever a vacancy happened. Rome, also, began to take an
interest in Cappadocia, and the only party without a voice in the affair,
consisted of the Cappadocians. They were assailed with the offer of freedom
and a republic at the point of the sword, on one side,&mdash;while, on
the other, they were asked to pin their faith to a monarchy which would
otherwise be pinned to them by the blades of a foreign army. The
Cappadocians had a wholesome horror of republican freedom, especially
when imported from abroad; and Rome, therefore, sent them a king,
who was accepted until his throne was overthrown by Mithridates&mdash;the
Cappadocians having to pay a heavy fine on each change of
government.</p>

<p>The king, who was thoroughly put out by Mithridates, applied to
Rome, which raised an army in three divisions; but the Romans were
so hated in Asia Minor, that they encountered every opposition from the
inhabitants. Appius and Aquilinus, who were leaders of two of the
divisions, soon fell into the hands of Mithridates, and it is said that he
punished their avarice by pouring melted gold down their throats; but
this is more than any one could swallow.</p>

<p>The Roman Senate, irritated by defeat, called upon L. Cornelius Sulla&mdash;or
Sylla, as, by an alteration of the first syllable, he is sometimes
called&mdash;to take the command of the army. The family boasted of its
antiquity, though one family must be quite as old as another, if everybody's
pedigree could be traced; and the real wonder would be to find a
man whose ancestors had a beginning, instead of the ordinary case of one
with an apparently endless line of progenitors. The family of Cornelius
Sulla claimed connection with that of Cornelius Rufinus, who, in the year
of Rome 540, instituted the Ludi Apollinares, in honour of Apollo, and in
conformity with the directions of the Sibylline books, from which he
had taken the name of Sibylla. This had, according to the interpretation
put upon it by family pride, been corrupted into Sulla; and such
is the empty boast of ancestry, that even corruption is eagerly acknowledged
as a proof of ancient lineage. The father of L. Cornelius Sulla
had left little&mdash;not even an unsullied name&mdash;to his son, but had been
equally wasteful of fortune and character. The boy was clever and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
quick, but his speediness speedily degenerated into fastness. Having
neither morality nor means, he took a cheap apartment, where he entertained
a low set, and there was nothing to be envied either in his room
or his company.</p>

<p>In early life he had distinguished himself as a soldier in the Jugurthine
War; and he subsequently obtained the office of Prætor, in which
he won the affections of the people, by introducing into the entertainments
of the amphitheatre the extraordinary attraction of 100 real
lions.</p>

<p>These noble animals had been the gift of a Mauritanian king, and as
Sulla might have wished the present absent, if he had been saddled
with the cost of the keep of no less than one hundred monarchs of the
forest, the donor forwarded a band of Moors, who were to serve as food
for the lions, by being turned into the arena with them when occasion
required.</p>

<p>Sulla had excited the jealousy of Marius during the Jugurthine War,
and the latter, though now a man of seventy, still cherished his old
animosity with all the obstinacy of a most inveterate veteran. He was
still ambitious of the laurel, though he should have been thinking only
of the cypress; and with one foot in the grave, he was anxious to march
with the other at the head of an army. Limping into the Campus
Martius, where the soldiers were being drilled, he placed himself by
the side of the youngest, and hobbled through the exercise with an
air of ill-assumed juvenility. His feeble evolutions excited a mixed
feeling of ridicule and disgust among the lookers-on, instead of obtaining
for him the command to which he aspired. Having been disappointed
of producing the effect he had anticipated, he had recourse to
his friend, the tribune P. Sulpicius, who exercised a sort of reign of
terror by means of 3000 gladiators, whom he always had about him.
This formidable band of armed ruffians went by the name of the
Anti-Senate of Sulpicius, who employed them to carry any measure he
proposed, by showing the point of the sword to those who did not see
the point of his argument. In order to gain time, the Senate appointed
a series of holidays, or Feriæ, during which all business was suspended
for the celebration of public sports, which often enabled the authorities
to play a game of their own, by delaying any measure that was opposed
to their interests. After a brief interval, the Senate appointed Sulla
to the chief command, whereupon the Anti-Senate appointed Marius;
and the former had no sooner heard the news, than he marched upon
Rome with the whole of his army. The utmost consternation ensued;
for no army having been expected at Rome, there had been no preparations
for defence; and though the gates were closed, they were
almost as crazy and unhinged as the terrified <a name="inhabitants" id="inhabitants"></a>inhabitants.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Marius discovered in the Marshes at Minturnæ.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />A feeble attempt was made to bolt the doors against Sulla and his
soldiers, but it was impossible to bar their entrance. As they marched
through the streets, they were assailed from the houses with showers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
brick, which, though very destructive, could not have been so damaging
as the modern mortar. Some of the inhabitants were armed with
slings, and now and then an arrow was discharged from a bow window.
Orders were immediately given to set fire to the quarters whence
the annoyance proceeded, and the directions were acted upon with
that indiscriminate ferocity which is too often displayed by an incensed
soldiery against an unarmed populace. The anger excited
by the few was vented on the unoffending many, and the troops performed,
with savage alacrity, the most humiliating service on which
they could have been employed&mdash;the butchery of their defenceless
fellow-citizens.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;Who dares kill Marius?&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />The leaders, or, rather, the mis-leaders of the people in this miserable
conspiracy, were the first to seek their own safety in flight, and the
tribune P. Sulpicius, who had set the example of employing brute force,
evinced the most cowardly haste in running away from it, when he
seemed likely to become one of its victims. Marius made for the
marshes near Minturnæ, where he stuck in the mud, and covered his
reputation with a number of stains that are quite indelible. On being
discovered in his ignoble retreat, by those who had pursued him through
thick and thin, he was dragged to the town and lodged in the nearest
station. A price had been put upon his head, but the article does not
seem to have been worth much, for he had shown very little sense in
the part he had been playing. His gray hairs, or, perhaps, rather, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
total baldness, still commanded so much of sympathy, that nobody
evinced a disposition to become his executioner, until a Cimbric soldier
undertook the discreditable office. He approached the veteran with a
drawn sword, but Marius had got into a dark corner, and succeeded in
frightening the man-at-arms by putting on a voice of the most dismal
character. The soldier fancying himself in the presence of a ghost,
failed in plucking up a sufficient spirit; and when a moan was heard&mdash;inquiring,
"Who dares kill Caius Marius?" the would-be assassin,
having flung down his sword, ran away, exclaiming&mdash;"Not I, for
one, at any rate!" The soldier, of course, exaggerated the cause of
his fears, and declared that the eyes of Marius had appeared to him
like two candles burning in their sockets. The inhabitants of Minturnæ
became as nervous as the panic-stricken soldier, and put Marius on
board a ship, which, after being tossed about for several days, came to
an anchor, or ran aground, high and dry, on the fine old crusted port of
Carthage. Here he rambled about the ruins, and rested his aching
head upon its broken temples. The Roman Governor, Sextilius, not
knowing what to do with such an embarrassing visitor, sent a messenger
to request him to "move on;" but the exile, with a dignified air,
claimed his right to repose upon the dry rubbish. "Tell thy master,"
he observed to the officer on duty, who had respectfully told him he
must "come out of that," in compliance with the orders of the authorities,&mdash;"Tell
thy master that thou hast seen Marius, sitting on the
ruins of Carthage." The intelligence was not new, but it seems to have
been rather startling, for it had the effect of causing Marius to be
allowed to remain; and we will, therefore, leave him there, while we
proceed with the march of our history.</p>

<p>Sulla having reduced the city to the most complete subjection, made
a merit of not pursuing his vengeance farther against the defenceless
inhabitants; and so great was his confidence in the efficacy of his
work, that he acquiesced in the appointment of L. Cornelius Cinna, a
partisan of Marius, to the consulship. Sulla proceeded to Greece,
where he blockaded Athens, whose inhabitants he plundered, as a practical
acknowledgment of their worth; and he spared their lives, to show
how he valued their ancestors. He manifested his respect for their arts
by robbing their city of its chief ornaments; and he paid their learning
the compliment of stealing their principal libraries.</p>

<p>In the meantime Cinna had entered on the duties of the consulship
at Rome, but there the truth of the maxim, that two heads are better
than one, was rendered extremely doubtful by the constant dissensions
between himself and his colleague. The latter was Cn. Octavius, who
opposed whatever the former recommended; and while one tried to
carry his measures by brute force, the other endeavoured to defeat them
by armed violence. Cinna appealed to the mob, and Octavius trusted
to the army, both forces being the principal movers under a republican
rule or misrule, and both being equally repugnant to the spirit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
constitutional government. The arms of such a republic might have for
its supporters the bludgeon and the sword, with the figure of Liberty
battered and bleeding, slashed and sabred, gagged and fettered, in the
middle. Octavius and the sword had, on this occasion, got the upper
hand; and Cinna, the clubbist, was glad to break his bludgeon or cut
his stick, in flying from the <a name="city" id="city"></a>city.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 399px;">
<img src="images/i_p0263.png" width="399" height="500" alt="Marius in the Ruins of Carthage." title="" />
<span class="caption">Marius in the Ruins of Carthage.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />The Senate decreed that he had forfeited the consulship, and Cinna,
having been well received in the Italian towns, decreed that the Senate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
had forfeited their authority. The Government was thus reduced to
two negatives, which could not make an affirmative; and in the midst
of a theoretical perfection of republican forms, there existed only the
substance of practical anarchy. The inhabitants of the Capitol, with the
sword at their throats, elected a Consul, who was, of course, declared by
the executive to be their free choice; while the people in the provinces
protested, as loudly as they dared, against the violence that had
been done to all the principles of law and liberty. Cinna, who had
possessed himself of large sums of public money, employed bribes and
promises to get himself acknowledged as the lawful Consul, for it is customary
with despotism, acting under the name of freedom, to rob the
people with one hand, in order to corrupt them with the other.</p>

<p>The veteran Marius, who, after making his bed on the ruins of
Carthage, was not too anxious to lie there, had been wanted to join the
party of Cinna, and the great captain of the age was received with
enthusiasm, in consideration of the great age of the captain. Papirius
Carbo and Q. Sertorius also gave in their adhesion; but Cn. Pompeius,
who was stationed with an army at Umbria, waited to see which side
would pay him best, and of those who would bid the highest, he was
prepared to do the bidding. Marius, in the meanwhile, landed in
Tuscany with a few friends; but to excite commiseration, he dressed
himself in rags, which was, indeed, putting on the garb of poverty.
He spoke so repeatedly of his reverses, and touched so frequently on his
old clothes, that the subject was completely threadbare. Rags are seldom
attractive, but in this instance, they were successful in obtaining for the
wearer a large crowd of followers.</p>

<p>Cn. Pompeius had at length consented to espouse the cause of the
Senate, but the alliance was one of interest on his side, for he would not
espouse anything without a very large pecuniary settlement having been
made in his favour. He met the army of Cinna under the walls of
Rome, but both forces were enfeebled by sickness. Each party proceeded
to do its best, but the soldiers on both sides were so wretchedly
ill, that none of them could, for one moment, stand at ease; and all
were much fitter to be in bed than in battle. A storm did sad havoc
among the defenders of Rome, and a flash of lightning falling naturally
upon the conductor of the army, caused the death of Cn. Pompeius.
The gates of the city were thrown open, Cinna was restored to the
Consulship, and though there had been an understanding that no blood
should be shed, Marius set a band of slaves and mercenaries upon the
defenceless people.</p>

<p>Under the pretence that he would only act according to law, this
sanguinary impostor, declaring himself an exile, pretended that he
would not enter the city until the sentence should be repealed; and with
a sword at every throat, he demanded an expression of the voice of the
people. The decision need scarcely be told, and Marius entered the
city, where, standing behind Cinna's consular chair, he made a series of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
savage grimaces at his intended victims. Among these was the Consul,
Octavius, who, soothed by the soothsayers into the belief that he had
nothing to fear, boldly refused to fly, until some hired assassins executed
their task, by executing the unhappy officer. He met his death
while still maintaining his seat, and expired in the arms of his armchair
of office.</p>

<p>Marius being now master of the situation, did all he could to make
the situation vacant by a system of indiscriminate murder. The heads of
the nation were not only imprisoned, but struck off. The two Cæsars
were savagely seized and killed, while Marc Antony&mdash;an orator of considerable
mark&mdash;had concealed himself in a place that was made known
to Marius. The tyrant was at supper when he heard the news, and as
if determined to sup full of horrors, he started up with a determination
to witness the murder, which he desired should immediately take place;
but his friends pacified him with the assurance that the head should be
brought in to him.</p>

<p>If the chroniclers are to be credited, Marc Antony owed his detection
to his fastidiousness as to the sort of wine that was placed before him.
While in concealment, his daily supply was procured from a neighbouring
tavern, by a messenger who was in the habit of tasting several
bottles before he was satisfied. This excited the curiosity of the landlord,
who became anxious to know the name of his very particular
customer. The messenger, on one occasion, had taken so much of
the wine in, that he let the truth out, when the wine-merchant
treacherously proceeded to betray the hiding-place of Marc Antony.
Soldiers were sent to his lodgings; but he grew so eloquent over his
generous wine, that he excited among the guards a generous spirit.
His life would probably have been spared, had not the tribune Annius
rushed up-stairs, and himself struck off the head of the unhappy
Antony.</p>

<p>Several men of consideration, in the most inconsiderate manner,
killed themselves, to avoid the fate which was intended for them by
Cinna, and that still greater sinner, Marius. Q. Lutatius Catulus
proceeded to the temple, and getting into a corner among the statues of
the gods, placing himself opposite Pan, perished by the fumes of charcoal.
Merula, the Flamen of Jupiter, may be said to have snuffed himself
out, or extinguished his own vital spark; for, seating himself in the
portico of the Capitoline, he calmly made preparations for suicide,
and took off his flame-coloured cap, in which it was not lawful for
him to expire. Producing some surgical instruments from his pocket,
he sat ruminating over his case, and taking out a lancet, he showed
that he was no longer in the vein to live, but quite in the vein to die,
for he opened an artery. The tyrant himself took to drinking in his
old age, and frequently rolled about in a state of frenzy, under the
impression that he was commanding an army against Mithridates.
He ultimately drove himself to <i>delirium tremens</i>, and he contracted a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
constant shake of the hands by his frequent use of cordials. He died
after a short illness, on the 15th of January, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 86, without having
devoted himself to that sober reflection, which would have induced him
to repent of his numerous enormities. Such was the end of a man,
whose faults have been sometimes glossed over with the varnish of
flattery, though at the hands of truth they can only receive an appropriate
coat of blacking.<br /><br /></p>

<h2><br /><br />CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SIXTH.</h2>

<h3>DEATH OF CINNA. RETURN OF SULLA TO ROME. C. PAPIRIUS CARBO.<br />
DICTATORSHIP OF SULLA.<br /><br /></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Liberty</span> being now established on a republican basis, by the massacre
of all who had a word to say against the military usurper Cinna, that
individual began the task of consolidating his power. He nominated
L. Valerius Flaccus to the consulship; and those of the aristocracy who
wished for freedom, were free to leave Rome if they did not like living
under a tyrannical government. To speak openly in the forum or the
courts of justice, was prohibited; and the scantiness of the reports that
have come down to us of the events of the times, can be no matter of
surprise, when we consider that the reporters were not permitted to give
an account of actual occurrences.</p>

<p>It was necessary to amuse the masses by what are termed liberal
measures, and as an excess of liberality, it was proposed that every
debtor, paying one fourth of his debt, should be released from all further
liability to his creditor. This was sure to be a popular act in a country
already ruined by political agitation, and the despotism to which it
frequently leads; and, as the debtors were by far the most numerous
class, a sort of general Insolvent Act was hailed with acclamations by a
bankrupt community.</p>

<p>Sulla, who was still in Greece, refused his allegiance to the despot at
home, and L. Valerius Flaccus was sent to supersede him in the
command of the army. Flaccus was not popular with his soldiers, and
as the head of the Government had set the example of setting aside all
law by a <i>coup d'état</i>, an imitator was soon found in the person of one
Flavius Fimbria, a lieutenant, who, by a <i>coup de tête</i>, got rid of his
obnoxious general. Flaccus being thus disposed of, Fimbria promoted
himself to the chief command; but, cowardice and cruelty going hand
in hand, he took his own life on hearing that Sulla was setting out
against him. The soldiers of Fimbria, with the most revolting faithlessness,
revolted to Sulla, who was now master of Asia. He called upon
the conquered nation for 20,000 talents, and as the subdued people had
not so large a sum by them, they were obliged to borrow it with one
hand at enormous interest, in order to pay it with the other. The
Roman capitalists lent the cash, and the Roman soldiers assisted them
with their swords to draw a ruinous per-centage from the unfortunate
borrowers. Sulla now prepared to march upon Rome, where Cinna had
re-elected himself as Consul, in conjunction with one Papirius Carbo, a
political incendiary, who acted like so much touch-paper and coal upon
the flame of discord. Intending to meet their rival, they proceeded with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
an army into Italy; but the soldiers no sooner found themselves on the
Italian soil, than they declared their determination to remain there.
Cinna called them together, and endeavoured to persuade them to go
forward, but even when he gave the word of command there was no
advance on his bidding. From passive resistance they proceeded to
active insubordination, and, denouncing him as a tyrant whom it was
high time to see through, they perforated him with their swords in
several places.</p>

<p>On the death of Cinna, legal authority began to raise its humbled
head, and Carbo was summoned to hold a Comitia at Rome; but on
the day appointed, the attendance of voters not promising a satisfactory
result, the augurs declared the auspices unfavourable, and dissolved the
meeting.</p>

<p>A deputation had been sent to Sulla to endeavour to make terms, but
the members of the deputation were forced to return without any terms
having been agreed upon. Sulla did not march immediately upon Italy,
but went to Ædepsus, in Eub&#339;a, for the benefit of the hot baths, though
he did not limit himself to the waters, for he addicted himself to the
spirits abounding in the neighbourhood. He amused himself in the
society of those who are sometimes said to live upon their wits, though
their existence is really derived from the want of wit in others. Sulla,
however, had a counterpoise to any demerits of his own, in the still
greater demerits of those who were opposed to him.</p>

<p>The new Consuls were L. Cornelius Scipio, a highly respectable man,
and C. Julius Norbanus, a mere creature of Carbo. Against these
leaders Sulla marched from Greece in the rudest health and the most
exuberant spirits. His pockets, however, were as light as his heart;
but this signified little, for the troops were so devoted to him that there
was not an officer unattached; and so far from making any difficulty
about their pay, they undertook to raise money among themselves, if
necessary, for the use of their leader.</p>

<p>The expedition landed at Brundusium, where the inhabitants received
Sulla with open arms, or rather without any arms at all, for they permitted
him to occupy the place without opposition. Passing through
Calabria and Apulia, he approached the encampment of Norbanus, in the
neighbourhood of Capua, and sent ambassadors to treat; but their treatment
was anything but courteous. They were insulted by all kinds of
abuse, and it is said that they had a great deal more thrown in their face
than mere reproaches. When Sulla heard of their reception, or rather
their rejection at the enemy's camp, he fell upon it with such force that
everything fell under him.</p>

<p>He next turned his attention to L. Scipio, whose army went over in
a body to the side of Sulla, while Scipio and his son were sitting
together, talking over general matters in the tent of the general.
L. Scipio had despatched his son with directions for the right division,
when the youth returned to say, that of the right division, there was not
one man left; and when Scipio himself went to look after his men, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
found there was not one remaining, even for the look of the thing, to
mount guard at the tent of their commander. He, of course, proposed
a series of strong resolutions, seconded by his son, that all those who
had joined Sulla were enemies to the state; but the state in which he
then was, rendered his denunciations idle, if not ridiculous. The
position of Sulla was becoming rather alarming to the party of Carbo,
who caused himself to be appointed Consul, for the year <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 82, in
conjunction with young C. Marius, who, as the heir of his father, had
inherited a large stock of wickedness. Cn. Pompeius had already sent
in his adhesion to Sulla, who had received him as a very promising
young man, for he had a fair share of popularity, and a good amount of
property. Young Pompey was opposed to old Carbo, and the former so
harassed the latter, that his temper, always sour, became equal to carbonic
acid in its inflammable tendency.</p>

<p>Sulla took young Marius in hand, and followed him up to a place
called Sacriportus, where, in consequence of a dream&mdash;for the ancients
were addicted to taking advice with their eyes shut&mdash;an attack by the
former on the latter was resolved upon. Sulla ordered his soldiers to
advance, but they were so fatigued that they fell asleep on the road, and
caused their leader to wonder what they could possibly be dreaming of.
Instead of their being equipped in the arms of the warrior, they were
stretched in the arms of Somnus, and Sulla, though reluctant to go
counter to his dream, perceived the folly of marching to battle with a
somnambulist army. He gave orders, therefore, to halt, and the men
had commenced digging the foundations for a camp, when the cavalry
of Marius rode up for the purpose of annoying them. Irritated by the
conduct of the enemy's horse, the soldiers of Sulla kicked against it, and
even while engaged in their work, picked out, with their pickaxes, a few
of the foremost of the Marian army. This led to a general engagement,
in which Sulla's forces forgot their fatigue, and pursued the
enemy to the neighbouring town of Præneste, the gates of which were
shut in such haste, that all the fugitives had not time to get in, and
Marius himself was pulled up by a rope over the wall, together with a few
immediate hangers-on, who had tied themselves to his fortunes. Sulla
is said to have slain 20,000 men, and to have taken 8000 prisoners,
while he lost only twenty-three; but as he is his own authority for the
statement,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> we must take in a purely figurative sense many of his figures.</p>

<p>The Marian party, fearing that the successes of Sulla might encourage
resistance to the despotism still prevailing at Rome, determined on
getting rid of the principal politicians of the day, the heads of the
National Assembly of the period. The modern practice might have
been to have shut up the place of meeting, and prevent the members,
by armed force, from going in&mdash;slaughtering them, of course, in case of
their perseverance; but the Marian policy was to summon them to the
Curia Hostilia, and having got them in, to butcher those who attempted
to go out again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
The prætor, L. Damasippus, was entrusted with this sanguinary
business; and every eminent politician, who was suspected of having an
independent opinion of his own, was at once massacred. This step was
declared to be necessary to give strength to the Government, and to
insure the unanimity of the nation, by cutting the throats of all who
ventured to be of a way of thinking contrary to that of the ruling power.
Unfortunately, some of the best and wisest men of the day were blind
to the virtues of the chief of the republic; and the whole of these,
including Q. Mucius Scævola, the eminent jurist, were unceremoniously
sacrificed.</p>

<p>The news of the success of Sulla at Sacriportus, caused a panic
among those who had been combining the butcher's business with that
of government at Rome, and the perpetrators tried to fly when they
heard the enemy was approaching the city. Sulla, leaving Lucretius
Ofella to keep watch at the gates of Præneste, lest Marius should attempt
to creep out, marched in person on the capital. Directing his steps
towards the Colline gate, he found there an army of those same Samnites,
who had been previously cut into so many pieces, and who were
ready to be cut into so many more, should occasion require the alarming
sacrifice. Their general, Pontius Telesinus, rode in front of them,
entreating them to come and be killed for positively the last time; and
the dux had sufficient influence to induce them to rush like a flock of
geese on their own destruction. The victory of Sulla was complete;
and Pontius Telesinus having been overlooked by the foe in the heat of
battle, supplied the omission in the business of the day by making away
with himself&mdash;after the usual cowardly fashion of the heroes of antiquity.</p>

<p>Sulla's success seemed only to have effected a change of tyrants; and
his conduct proved that the monster grievance of Rome was the series
of inhuman monsters who had got hold of the government. The
atrocities attributed to Sulla are, however, so enormous, as almost to
border on the burlesque; and it is comfortable to feel in the exaggeration
a ground for hope that in the account furnished by the historians,
much may fall under the head of "Errors excepted."</p>

<p>It is said that 3000 of the enemy at Antennæ implored his mercy,
which he granted, on the understanding that they were to assassinate
their associates&mdash;a service that was performed with brutal
eagerness. When the 3000 claimed their own pardon as a reward,
they were, according to Plutarch, conveyed to Rome, and butchered
with a few thousand others, who had the misfortune to differ in opinion
with the chief of a republican government.</p>

<p>It was found so extremely embarrassing to heads of families and
others who were liable every day or hour to be cut off, that it was at
length proposed, as a matter of convenience, that Sulla should save
time by publishing a short list, containing the few names of those
whom he did not intend to sacrifice. He replied, by bringing out a
very long list of those he did, which he stated to be merely the first
number of a serial work, which he did not pledge himself to complete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
within any particular period. As every copyright is liable to be
infringed, the work of Sulla was the subject of numerous imitations;
and there were many who made lists of their own, containing names disagreeable
to themselves; so that no man could walk the streets without
the chance of reading his own death-warrant on the walls of the capital.
Sulla, in many instances, offered rewards for the heads of his victims,
and his doors were beset from morning till night with the cry of,
"Butcher!" by those who called for the sums they had earned as
slaughtermen. Assassinations proceeded to such a fearful degree, that
Q. Catulus asked Sulla, in confidence, whether it was the intention of
the latter to spare any human being at all? for there seemed a chance
of his having no one left to rule over but himself; and such a man was
likely to find self-government exceedingly difficult.</p>

<p>While these things were going on at Rome, Marius was besieged in
Præneste, from which he tried to make his escape through the common
sewer; a mode of insuring his life that was far from dignified. He,
however, was espied through an iron aperture, which was so grating to
his feelings, that he called upon his slave to run him through; when
the faithful fellow immediately bored him to death with a trusty and
rusty weapon.</p>

<p>Sulla, the perpetrator of all the acts of despotism and cruelty which
are above described, was without any legal authority, and had no more
right than the meanest subject of the republic to the power which he
exercised. His reign was a reign of terror, supported by the swords of
a sordid soldiery. Of the two Consuls, Marius was already dead; and
Carbo, being taken prisoner, was condemned to death; so that Carbo&mdash;the
blackness of whose conduct justified his title of the coal&mdash;was soon
reduced to ashes.</p>

<p>The senate, which had been cut down by assassination to suit the
views of Sulla, elected L. Valerius Flaccus as interrex, who immediately
caused Sulla to be invested with the power of doing whatever he
liked, as long as he liked; or, to use the official phraseology, made
him dictator for an unlimited period.</p>

<p>On receiving his appointment, the first measure of Sulla was
to reward the tools who had assisted him, and L. Valerius Flaccus
was immediately made master of the horse, while the military
murderers, who had acted as executioners in the execution of his plans,
received grants of land in the places which had been unfavourable to the
tyrant. He courted a certain sort of popularity by extending the suffrage
to some 10,000 emancipated slaves, who retained enough of their
slavishness to cause them to vote as their master desired. He affected
to reconstitute the legislative body which he had illegally destroyed, and
he sent into it a quantity of that noxious scum which, in the troubled
waters of revolution, is frequently cast up to the surface of society.</p>

<p>Having established his position through the brutality of one part of
the people, and the cowardice of the other, he set about the business of
a reformer; and, though he did much harm, the little good that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
accomplished must not be denied to him. Being a despot by nature,
he limited, as far as he could, the popular element in the constitution,
by curtailing the power of the tribunes; and he increased the government
patronage by adding to the number of pontiffs and augurs, so that
he might have the privilege of appointment to lucrative, but useless,
offices. His changes in the criminal code were, however, really beneficial,
for he made murder, whether committed by poison or violence, a
crime by law; and, indeed, it was necessary that the point should be
clearly defined, for military murders at the hands of the executive had
been so numerous that it was reasonably doubted whether human life
was henceforth to be protected at all by the government. Many old
laws were re-enacted, though they had never been repealed; but the
usurpers of power had so thoroughly trampled on every legal form, that
it was impossible to know which of the laws were to be regarded as
imperative on the people.</p>

<p>Sulla, and his friends, boasted that his firmness had given tranquillity
to Rome; but tranquillity can scarcely be a desirable condition to one
whose quietude is the result of a gag in the mouth, a sword suspended
over the head, and chains on every part of the body. The repose, or
rather, the stillness thus obtained, was no less costly than inconvenient,
for there was a wholesale confiscation of the property of all who were
supposed to entertain views different from those of the government.
The iniquities of the master will often be followed by the man, and,
in conformity with this rule, a fellow, named Chrysogonus, one of
Sulla's creatures, caused the murder of Roscius of Armenia, in order to
get the opportunity of robbing him. The property of Roscius was
knocked down at a mock auction to a bad lot of ruffians, who were
there to intimidate the auctioneer into doing their smallest bidding.
Everything went for positively nothing, and Chrysogonus was understood
to have got nearly the whole of it at a ludicrously low figure.</p>

<p>The laws made by Sulla, though perhaps plain enough in their
purport, had an ambiguity in their application which was extremely
inconvenient. Though binding at some times, in some places, upon
some persons, they were not so at other times, in other places, upon
others. He had laid it down as a rule that no one could be elected
consul until he had been prætor; though, in the case of his own
adherents, Sulla was not at all particular. When, however, L. Ofella,
the commander at Præneste, who had never been prætor, put up for the
consulship, Sulla declared such conduct was not to be put up with at all,
and had him killed in the middle of a morning's canvass. The people
were rather angry at the outrage, when Sulla, walking among a group
with a sword in his hand, "demanded silence for an anecdote."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> A
circle drew round him, tremblingly alive to what he was about to say,
when the despot proceeded as follows: "A labourer," said he, "was at
work at the plough, when he was annoyed by insects, which caused him
to stop and beat them off by dusting his own jacket. Finding himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
annoyed a second time he took off his jacket and threw it into the fire.
Now, I advise those whom I have twice conquered not to oblige me to
try the fire," The people, who knew something of Sulla's threatened
fire, dreaded it with all the horror of a burned child, and he was left to
pursue his career of unchecked atrocity.</p>

<p>A man who has the cruelty of a brute has, generally, the other
debasing appetites of the lower order of animals; and Sulla had as
much of the sensualist as of the tyrant in his character. To a thirst
for blood he added the appetite of a glutton; and, having amassed
enormous wealth by murder and rapine, he longed for the opportunity
to expend his ill-gotten means in idleness and debauchery. He
accordingly called the people together in the forum, and, having
walked up and down for some time asking if anybody dared to make a
charge against him, he resigned the dictatorship. This abdication has
been lauded by some as a proof of magnanimity and disinterestedness;
but, to sum up the truth in a few words, he had practised human
butchery as a trade, and, having realised an enormous fortune, he
retired from business. Having secured all the profits that were likely
to accrue from his unprincipled career, he left to others the difficult
work of sustaining the results of his policy. He retired to Puteoli,
where he passed much of his time in the company of actors, and became
the intimate associate of one or two popular low comedians. In his sober
moments&mdash;which were very few during the latter part of his life&mdash;he
wrote his own memoirs, and was employed upon the work until within
a few days of his death, which happened <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 78, when he had reached
the age of sixty. Seldom had a man, who had reached but three-score,
left so many scores unsatisfied. Such was his cruelty, that he
delighted in loading prisoners with fetters, and then shedding their
blood, which caused it to be said of him that he was no less fond of
mangling than of ironing. He had so little regard for old associations,
that when one of his acquaintances reminded him of the days
when they lived in the same house&mdash;Sulla paying 2000 sesterces
for the basement, and his former friend 3000 for the first floor&mdash;the
Dictator refused to spare his fellow-lodger's life, but brutally
remarked, that the story, whether upper or lower, was an old one, and
had long ago lost its interest. It is said that dungeons or cellars
were attached to Sulla's house for the purpose of keeping a supply of
human beings always on hand for occasional sacrifice. The manner
of his death rendered him an object as repulsive as he had become by
his mode of life; for, his licentiousness led to a disease which developed
itself in the generation of vermin in his skin; and he may be said to
have been almost eaten up with corruption before he expired. By his
own desire his body was burned; as if he had thought that fire might
act in some sort as a purifier of his memory. The ladies of the nobility
threw perfume on the funeral pile,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> but it was too late to bring him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
into good odour. Numerous attendants carried spices of every kind;
and, in addition to the ordinary mace-bearers, there were several officers
laden with cinnamon. The fact of incense having been offered at the
funeral pile of such a monster, is enough to incense any one who reads
a statement so humiliating to humanity.<br /><br /></p>

<p><br /><br />In personal appearance Sulla was by no means attractive; for he
had a quantity of green in his eye, an abundance of red in his hair,
and a profusion of purple in his countenance. His face was, like his
character, full of spots; and those who accused him of aspiring to the
purple, said the fact might be read in his look, for his cheeks were of
blue, and caused himself, as well as his acts, to wear a very dark complexion.
He was coarse in his manners, and had no appreciation of
any kind of delicacy but the delicacies of the table. Notwithstanding
the unpleasant features of Sulla's person and character, he was married
five times; for divorce had become so easy, that a man could always
put his old wife away when he wished for a new one.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left:-1em" class="smcap">he</span> tyrannical acts of Sulla had
smothered, but not extinguished, the
flame of liberty, and every piece
of injustice had been so much fuel
heaped upon a smouldering fire. At
the death of Sulla, the population
consisted of little else than those
who had been beggared by a rapacious
soldiery, and the military desperadoes
who had done the tyrant's
work; a melancholy combination of
the victimisers and the victimised.
The Consuls were M. Æmilius Lepidus
and Q. Lutatius Catulus; the
former having enriched himself by
connexion with the dictator's party,
but the tide having turned, he turned
with it, in the hope that it might again lead on to fortune. Catulus, on
the other hand, adhered to the policy of Sulla; and there being reason
to fear that the two Consuls would get up a quarrel&mdash;in the course
of which the lookers-on would be robbed&mdash;the Senate made the Consuls
swear that they would not take up arms against each other. The
oath was readily taken, and no less readily broken by those republican
chiefs, who came into violent collision near the very gates of Rome;
and Lepidus, having got the worst of it, fled to Sardinia, where, having
laid down his plans for the future, he laid down himself, and died
rather unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Several of the laws of Sulla were so manifestly unjust as to be indefensible
even by his own partisans; and many of them were repealed
under various consulships. Cn. Pompey, who had been a warm
adherent of the dictator, had a much warmer feeling for himself, and he
courted popular favour by the promise of many reforms which involved
a compromise of his former principles. The republic was, in fact, the
sport of a set of unprincipled men, who were trying, by every artifice
and crime, to get to the head of it. They cared nothing for the public
interests, but thought only of their own; which will be too often the
case when the chief power in the state is open to any who will make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
highest bid for it. Pompey had gone into the market with his abilities
when tyranny required tools; but perceiving that demagogues were
now in demand, he endeavoured to make a profit of popular principles.
Others had embarked on the same voyage, shifting their course with the
breath of public opinion, and having no rudder but self-interest. One
of these was L. Licinius Lucullus, a man of excessive wealth, which he
used, or rather abused, in excessive luxury. He employed art for the
purpose of opposing nature; and, among other pieces of prodigality, he
endeavoured to convert a portion of the sea into a private fish-pond.
This he attempted at his winter residence near Naples; where, by a
cutting through the rocks he formed an opening into the bay, and kept
upon his own premises a continual supply of fresh fish in a reservoir of
salt water. His tastes were not, however, limited to the pleasures of
the dinner-table; for he had not only studied the law, and had the
Twelve Tables at his fingers' ends, but he had collected a library of such
vast extent, that it comprehended a store of information far beyond the
comprehension of its owner.</p>

<p>M. Licinius Crassus was another candidate for power, which he sought
rather by means of his wealth, than his talents; for he had far more
money than wit; and Crassus often evinced signs of crass ignorance.</p>

<p>Almost the only illustrious man of the period was C. Julius Cæsar,
who could turn his hand, no matter what was in it, to anything. He
was as ready with the pen as with the sword; but the latter was not
sharper than his tongue; while his mind was so capacious and elastic,
that it could adapt itself to small or great things with equal facility. A
very little subject is often lost in the vast expanse of a very great
intellect; and a diminutive understanding cannot afford space for the
admission of a grand idea; but there was suitable accommodation for
either one or the other, or both at once, in the self-adapting mind of
Cæsar. He was an author without jealousy, a scholar without pedantry,
and a politician without quackery.</p>

<p>These, and other illustrious men, flourished in Rome about this
time; but Pompey, who had a natural love of pomp, possessed the art
of concentrating upon himself the rays reflected from the brilliant
personages who surrounded him; so that it was difficult to distinguish
at all times between him and the other men of distinction of the period.</p>

<p>During the lifetime of Sulla, Q. Sertorius had been serving, or rather
commanding, in Spain, where he held the post of prætor, and was engaged
in keeping the interests of his party&mdash;that of Marius&mdash;alive, by killing
all who were opposed to them. His professed object was to unite
Spaniards and Romans as one people; but his mode of reconciling any
differences was to put to the sword those who, after he had put their
opinions to the test, were found to disagree with him. Sulla had sent
an army, under C. Annius, to attack Sertorius in Spain, when Sertorius,
looking upon C. Annius as a mere deputy, with whom a deputy on his
side might deal, despatched Julius Salinator to meet the envoy. The
result proved that the prætor had done wisely in acting on his discretion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
rather than giving way to any sudden impulse of valour; for Salinator,
whom he had sent as a substitute for himself, was killed, when,
in his capacity of proxy, he approximated too closely to the enemy.</p>

<p>Sertorius, who had sent out Salinator as a sort of feeler&mdash;not exactly
expecting that the latter would have to feel his death-blow&mdash;perceived
there was little prospect of his own success; and he made his escape to
Africa. While in Mauritania, having no quarrel of his own, he interfered
in the quarrels of other people; and there being two claimants to
the Mauritanian crown, he supported one, and&mdash;by way of keeping his
hand in&mdash;picked the pocket of the other. His meddling having paid
him extremely well, he made up his mind and his luggage to retire
into private life, and an account he had heard of the Canary Islands
tempted him to deposit his well-feathered nest in that congenial locality.</p>

<p>The Lusitanians, however, who had been robbed by the Romans
belonging to Sulla's party, having a vague idea of the propriety of
setting a thief to catch a thief, entreated Sertorius to defend them
against their enemies. The engagement was entered into after some
little delay as to the terms; when Sertorius set to work with so much
ardour, that he was soon fighting four Roman generals at once; and,
what was still more remarkable, he was getting decidedly the best of it.
His mode of warfare was to pour down from one fastness to another
with such speed, that his foes never knew where to have him, until he
had them in the most unexpected manner. If they began to march,
says Plutarch, he was upon their heels,&mdash;if they sat still, he was upon
their back,&mdash;and if they invested a town, he turned the investment to
his own profit by intercepting all their convoys. The enemy had no
resource against his arms but their own legs, for flight was their sole
safeguard.</p>

<p>Not satisfied with fighting the battles of the Spaniards, he began
regulating their civil domestic affairs, and endeavoured to translate the
Spanish into the Roman character. His object was to establish a
Roman republic in Spain; but it is difficult to manufacture a foreign
article of native materials. He appointed 300 persons as a senate;
and, though the greater part were Spaniards, he took as many proscribed
Romans as he could find, in the hope that they would serve as
a sort of Roman cement, to make it hold together. He established a
school&mdash;a classical academy&mdash;where Latin and Greek were taught, and
where the pupils wore boys' tunics, after the Roman fashion.</p>

<p>Sertorius was a general favourite with all classes, besides the classes
of the school; and happening to have a favourite fawn, which followed
him wherever he went, flattery declared the fawn was sent him by the
gods, as a mark of favour.</p>

<p>Fortune appeared to favour him in all he undertook; and even
Q. Metellus, with a large army, could produce no effect,&mdash;a failure that
was attributed to the age and imbecility of that illustrious veteran.
Sertorius was joined by Perperna, who, on the strength of the forces he
brought, expected to share in the command; but such is the influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
of success, that Perperna's men repudiated their own leader, and
insisted on having Sertorius as their general.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_p0278.png" width="400" height="314" alt="Sertorius and his young Friends." title="" />
<span class="caption">Sertorius and his young Friends.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />The constant arrival of unfavourable news at Rome, at length induced
Pompey to exclaim&mdash;"This will never do; I must go and settle the
matter myself;" for Pompey's conceit induced him to conceive that
he should easily conquer Sertorius. The latter was besieging Lauro,
the modern Liria, to which the former advanced for the purpose of
relieving it. There was, near the walls, a hill that it was important to
possess, and both parties tried for it; but Sertorius, setting his eye on
the top, was the first to get up to it. Pompey, with consummate vanity,
expressed his determination to dislodge the fellow forthwith, and sent a
message to the town, desiring the inhabitants to sit upon the walls,
that they might see how cleverly he would dispose of their enemy.
Sertorius, on hearing the boast, observed, smilingly, that "a general
should watch behind as well as before,"&mdash;an observation that Pompey,
who did not see behind him at the time, would often afterwards look
back upon. Sertorius had, in fact, a very considerable reserve, with
which he hemmed the besiegers in while he burned the inhabitants out,
to the utter astonishment of Pompey, who, though near enough to the
flames to warm his hands, could not interfere without burning his
fingers.</p>

<p>Pompey was, nevertheless, impatient to measure swords with Sertorius;
an operation which, though it seems indicative of coming to close quarters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
must always keep a soldier at arm's length, at least, from his antagonist.
Desirous of all the glory that might be obtained, Pompey, hearing that
Metellus was coming up with assistance, resolved on precipitating a
battle, and he accordingly commenced one rather late in the afternoon,
though he knew he might be quite in the dark as to the issue.
Sertorius and Pompey each advanced at the head of a division, but by
some accident they did not happen to meet; and each of them came
back to the main body of his army with the conviction that he had
been victorious. On the renewal of the conflict the generals met, the
armies knocked their two heads together, when Pompey, being stunned
by the blow, and having no one to advise him what to do, took to flight
for the purpose of consulting his own safety.</p>

<p>Though apparently invincible by his enemies, Sertorius was not
safe from his friends, for he was murdered at a dinner-party given to
him by Perperna. The cloth had not been removed, when Sertorius
was startled by a singular <i>entrée</i>, in the shape of a band of assassins,
who set upon him and slew him. So much was he respected by the
Spaniards, that it is said his death brought dying suddenly into fashion,
and many killed themselves at his funeral, for the purpose of taking
Sertorius as their pattern. Perperna immediately declared himself
commander-in-chief, but he was quite unfit for the place, and in his very
first engagement he was cut to pieces, with the whole of his army.
Whether they were literally cut to pieces, is a matter of doubt to us,
though the account is placidly adopted by the graver historians; but
when we consider the quantity of cutting and coming again of the same
parties&mdash;as exemplified particularly in the case of the Samnites&mdash;which
we are continually called upon to place faith in, we find belief
rather difficult.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 261px;">
<img src="images/i_p0280.png" width="261" height="350" alt="Armed Slave" title="" />
<span class="caption">Armed Slave</span>
</div>
<p>While <a name="these_things" id="these_things"></a>these things were proceeding in Spain, the slaves were going
on in the most perplexing manner in Italy and its neighbourhood.
Some of the ablest of them had been trained in gladiatorial schools to
afford amusement in the Circus; but this outrage to humanity brought
much misery in its train to those who were the cause of it. The slaves
were exercised in the use of all sorts of weapons, and humanity was
lowered by hiring them out for shows on public occasions. Being
skilled in the employment of the sword, they began to think of wielding
it against their oppressors, instead of trying it upon each other, and
about seventy of them escaped under the leadership of a Thracian of
their body, named Spartacus. Being unprovided with arms, they
plundered the cook-shops, where they seized spits for spears, skewers
for daggers, carving knives for swords, dripping-pans for shields, and
basting-spoons for general purposes. They next entered the shops
of the carpenters, and seized the tools of the workmen, many of
whom concealed the implements of their industry; but, if a saw
happened to show its teeth, it was immediately captured. Their
party, though at first small, was increased by all the runaway debtors
of the district; for it is a remarkable fact that those who owe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
privately more than they can pay, are often foremost among those
who talk the loudest about what they owe to the public interests.
They took up their position on Mount
Vesuvius&mdash;an appropriate place for
a breaking out&mdash;and their numbers
having swelled to 10,000, they poured
themselves down, like a devastating
stream of lava, on many neighbouring
towns, which were speedily laid in
ashes. Spartacus pushed forward as
far as the foot of the Alps; but his
followers were intent on returning to
Rome, in order to sack it, and add
its contents to their baggage. M.
Licinius Crassus was sent after him;
and having undertaken to overtake
him, came up with him in Lucania.
The slaves fought like lions, or,
rather, with the ferocity of the brutes
with whom they had been taught
to contend, and were, in some instances, victorious.
</p>

<p>Crassus had sent Mummius to keep the army in check, but the latter
had received particular directions not to fight; for the object of the
republican general was to take all the glory for himself, irrespective of
his country's interests. Mummius, however, had the same feeling, and
was desirous of winning a reputation, regardless of the orders of his
superior; for he knew that a military success, in the unstable condition
of the executive, would, however irregular, be passed over by the
people, and perhaps made a stepping-stone for himself to supreme
power. His men, who were not actuated by the same personal motives
as himself, saw the insufficiency of their force, and, being seized with a
panic, ran away, without stopping to draw their swords from their
scabbards. Spartacus formed the idea of passing into Sicily, and proceeded
to Rhegium, where he bargained with some pirates to supply
him with vessels; but after pretending much friend-ship, they never
furnished him with any ship at all, though he had paid the knaves the
price of a small navy.</p>

<p>Spartacus found himself blockaded in Rhegium; and Crassus, cutting
a trench all round, thought to prevent all egress from the place; but
neither Crassus nor his trench proved deep enough to answer the
purpose proposed, for Spartacus filled up a portion of the ditch, and
walked over it. Crassus, now fearing that his cause was lost, sent to
Rome for the assistance of Pompey, who, priding himself on his previous
victories, and mentally ejaculating, "I'm the only man; they 're always
obliged to send for me," proceeded to meet Spartacus. No sooner had
Crassus sent for help, than he recovered from his panic, and sent to say
he should require no aid; but he had calculated in the absence of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
host, for when the host of Spartacus appeared, Crassus found it no easy
matter to contend with them. The latter, however, grown too confident
of success, determined on running the chance of striking or receiving a
decisive blow, notwithstanding the misgivings of their leader.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 385px;">
<img src="images/i_p0281.png" width="385" height="450" alt="Spartacus." title="" />
<span class="caption">Spartacus.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />Spartacus commenced the day by sending for his horse, and killing
it, to the utter astonishment of the spectators, and the intense bewilderment
of the unfortunate animal. "If I win the day," said he, "I shall
have many better horses; but if I lose it, the poor creature would be
useless to me in my very humble walk of life, or my more probable
walk out of it." Such was his only mode of accounting for an act,
which none who pitied the suffering of an equine animal could regard
with equanimity. On the day of the battle, Spartacus was soon
wounded, but falling on his knees, he continued to fight in that uneasy
position. Being at last overpowered, he fell, with 40,000 of his
men, who, according to the authorities, were sent to destruction; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
though there is no hesitation in saying where they went, the question
where they came from, is one which the grave historians have paid no
attention to. Of the whole 40,000 who are said to have been found
dead upon the field, it is asserted that two only had their backs
to the foe; but we suspect that if there had been time for the defeated
to have turned themselves round, there would have been many more in
the same position.</p>

<p>Crassus marched towards Rome, expecting to be received with
enthusiasm; but Pompey who had met and exterminated 3000
Thracians, sent a letter home, declaring that "what Crassus had done
was all very well, but that he (Pompey) had really put an end to the
war by his act of determined butchery." Knowing the value attached
by a military republic to a sanguinary act, he was sanguine enough to
expect the office of Consul. This he obtained in conjunction with his
rival Crassus, who laid himself out, and laid out a considerable sum of
money as well, for the purchase of mob popularity. He gave the
people corn for nothing, and invited them to dinner-parties of
10,000 at a time; but his prodigality only proves the extent of his
plunder, for nothing could have gone into the public mouth, but that
which had in some shape or other come out of the public pocket.
Pompey, on the other hand, practised the profession of humility, which
perhaps answered better in a double sense; for it was certainly cheaper,
and possibly somewhat more effective, than ostentatious prodigality. He
used to lead his own horse in a procession, to show that he was a
simple <i>eques</i>, on a footing of equality with other citizens. When his
consulship was at an end, he retired into a private station, where he
lived like a prince&mdash;a style that seems to be much in favour with those
who preach the doctrine of perfect equality.</p>

<p>It was impossible for such an active participator in public affairs to
remain wholly idle; and the alarming spread of piracy soon gave him
an opportunity for really honourable distinction. The pirates were
becoming a scourge to Rome, but Rome had richly deserved it, for it
had been her own injustice that had called into existence these
dangerous enemies to humanity. They consisted, in the first instance,
of men ruined by Roman extortion, who took to the mountains and the
sea, where the true excitement of the ups and downs of life may be
most vividly experienced. These men had in time been joined by the
once rich and noble, some of whom, having sold the wives and families
they could no longer keep, began to plough the ocean as the only field
of enterprise. Piracy thus became a regular business of man, just as
in more civilised times it has become a regular part of the business of
bookselling. Towns were plundered, the cattle were carried off, and
the inhabitants walked off to captivity. The rich were frequently kidnapped
on the roads, and nothing but a handsome ransom would obtain
their liberty.</p>

<p>The pirates had been often reduced, but had never been rooted out;
and the tribune, A. Gabinius, proposed, therefore, that Pompey should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
be called upon to do extraordinary things with extraordinary powers.
He was to have supreme command for three years, during which period
he was to have whatever was asked, and to order everybody or everything
that he required. He took his own measures extremely well,
and took the measure of the pirates also with such effect, that he soon
drove them from all their fastnesses, with a speed quite marvellous.</p>

<p>Though his extraordinary powers had been conferred upon him for
three years, he had such still more extraordinary power over himself, that
he made a voluntary surrender of the former, when the object for which
they had been entrusted to him was accomplished. Everything was
achieved in three months, during which period he had taken several
towns, none of which he had kept to himself, though one of them, in
Cilicia, called Soli, he made a solitary exception of, by giving it the
name of Pompeiopolis. The people of Soli talked a mixed dialect of
Asiatic and Greek, which caused such a confusion of speech, that a great
deal of confounded nonsense was the result; and it is said that the
word solecism, as applied to an inaccuracy of speech, is derived from
the name of the place alluded to.</p>

<p>That the Romans should have been hostile to piracy is somewhat
inconsistent with the principle, or rather the want of principle, on which
they acted themselves, for they pirated almost everything. Their
literature was mere piracy from the Greeks; and according to some
authorities, the Romans pirated even from the pirates themselves; for
the former are said to have pirated from the latter the idea of the
system of the Zodiac.</p>

<p>The pirates carried on their lawless trade with such success, that
they had a fleet of more than 1000 galleys, many of them being handsomely
gilded&mdash;a fact that glossed over in the eyes of many the iniquity
of the means by which such wealth had been acquired. A dash of gaiety
is said to have pervaded the enormities of these lawless depredators;
and when among their prisoners they captured a Roman of high rank,
they would politely request him to walk into the sea; for "to enslave
one of the lords of the earth was an act they could not think of being
guilty of." Young Julius Cæsar, who fell into their hands when a mere
boy, on his voyage to Rhodes, appears to have met them more than
half way in their sallies of humour. They asked twenty talents for
his ransom, when he offered them fifty; and even then was so little
anxious to leave them, that he remained thirty-eight days after having
paid his money and become entitled to his quittance. During his stay
among them he wrote satirical verses on their barbarous mode of life,
and parried off their swords by the still keener weapons of ridicule.
The pirates were amused by the sallies of their prisoner, who conveyed
to them all the bluntness of truth in all the sharpness of epigram.
They were sorry enough to part with him, when the money for his
ransom arrived; but they had reason to be still more sorry when they
met him again; for when he did so, it was only to capture them and
carry them to Pergamus.</p>

<h2><br />CHAPTER THE TWENTY-EIGHTH.</h2>

<h3>THE THIRD MITHRIDATIC WAR. DEPOSITION AND DEATH OF<br />
MITHRIDATES.<br /><br /></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Pompey had been busy in punishing the pirates, Rome had
something to fear from another quarter; for Mithridates had been
everywhere beating up for recruits to beat down the Commonwealth.
He was extremely rich, and had an army of 150,000 men; for the
trade of war is unhappily one of those in which there is never any lack
of hands ready to wage war, when their wages can be relied upon.</p>

<p>Bithynia was one of the first objects of the attack of Mithridates,
who was opposed by the Consul, M. Cotta; but the place was burned to
the ground, and the ashes of poor Cotta were found in the condition of
terra cotta among the ruins. Lucullus, the colleague of Cotta, was
sent into Asia with a great army, which attacked Mithridates with such
effect, that the king only saved his own life by emptying his pockets of
all the money he had about him, and making a scramble of it among
the hostile soldiers. The mercenaries, in fighting with each other for
the loose silver, forgot to make sure of the sovereign. Mithridates fled
to his son-in-law Tigranes, who, having named the metropolis Tigranocerta,
after himself, had established himself as King of Armenia.
Lucullus proceeded across the Tigris, and required that Mithridates
should be given up; but Tigranes, looking at his venerable though
determined father-in-law, referred the legate for an answer to the old
gentleman. The King of Pontus answered by requesting that the
enemy would come and take him, which the Romans were actually
about to do, when Mithridates and Tigranes thought it safer to run for
their lives; Tigranes ingloriously taking his crown from his head, and
putting it in his pocket, to avoid being recognised.</p>

<p>The treasury of Tigranocerta, with a surplus of two millions sterling,
fell into the hands of the Romans, who seized on the spoil, and who had
become so independent by their temporary wealth, that they criticised,
approved, and abused or disobeyed, when and why they pleased, the
orders of their general.</p>

<p>Mithridates, taking advantage of this state of things, collected a
numerous army, and fell wherever he could upon the Roman garrisons.
On one occasion he approached so near the enemy as to be within a
stone's throw, and as they happened to be throwing stones, he received
one on the knee; while an arrow, fixing itself under the eye, at once
opened it to the full extent of his danger. He soon recovered from the
effect of his wounds, and was ready by the ensuing spring to attack
C. Triarius, when a Roman soldier, disguised as a native, pretended to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
whisper something in the ear of Mithridates, at the same time giving
him a most unfriendly poke in the ribs with a concealed weapon. The
King was so unprepared for the wound that he fainted right away, and
his troops were so taken up in catching him, that they forgot to catch
the foe, who were suffered to escape, though they might otherwise have
been easily seized upon. Mithridates, having come to, expressed his
anger at the carelessness of his officers, and, notwithstanding his wound
and his age, he would have attempted the pursuit&mdash;under difficulties&mdash;of
the enemy. The next morning he renewed the attack on Triarius,
and cut to pieces 7000 men; an operation, however, which seems
almost too extensive for even the scissors of Fate, and we cannot help
regarding it, therefore, as a sheer invention of the graver historians.</p>

<p>Pompey was now sent to supersede Lucullus in the command; a
measure that had become doubly necessary, for Lucullus had not only
failed as a leader, but his soldiers were daily refusing to follow him.
When his troops approached within a short distance of Mithridates, they
seemed more inclined to engage with him in a friendly than in a hostile
sense, for many of them joined his forces. Soon after the arrival of
Pompey, a battle was fought by night on the banks of the Euphrates.
The moon, being near its setting, had lengthened the reflection cast by
the Roman troops, and the soldiers of Mithridates, mistaking the
reflection for the substance, began fighting most energetically with
mere shadows. Every missile, thrown apparently into the midst of
the Romans, was as ineffective as a miss, and the soldiers of Mithridates
believing the foe to be invulnerable, fled in a state of panic.
The King himself fought valiantly at the head of his body-guard; a
corps which counted among its members his own wife, who, in the arms
of a man, committed fearful havoc upon the Roman soldiery. Notwithstanding
the powerful assistance of this strong-minded and able-bodied
woman, Mithridates was compelled to fly, though he made extensive
arrangements for renewing the war on the first favourable opportunity.
This opportunity seems never to have arrived, or, if it came, it was
lost by the treachery and cowardice of his son Pharnaces, who persuaded
the soldiers that his father was an old fool to think of fighting
with the Romans. Several of the principal officers took the same
view of the subject, and joined in a conspiracy to depose the King, for
the purpose of setting up Pharnaces as his substitute.</p>

<p>Mithridates was in bed one morning, when, woke by a considerable
shouting under his window, he heard the words, "Pharnaces is king!"
and sent to know the meaning of such an outcry. The answer was
unsatisfactory, when the veteran, mounting his charger, made a speech
on horseback, which nobody listened to. His son gave orders that he
should be seized, when the old man, putting spurs to his horse,
galloped up a hill, which for a man in the decline of life, who had been
going down hill rather rapidly, was a bold and hazardous experiment.
From the eminence he had gained, he saw the depth to which he had
fallen; for he witnessed the coronation of his son Pharnaces, amidst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the acclamations of the army. The poor old man was so affected at the
sight, that he took from a fold in his dress a deadly drug, which, in
anticipation of an alarming self-sacrifice, he always carried about with
him. He was about to take off the mixture, when his two daughters,
who were standing at his side, entreated the privilege of a drink at the
deadly decoction. For some time he hesitated; but he was at length
touched by their looks of mute entreaty at the fatal liquid. Dividing
the contents of the bottle into three parts, he gave a dose to each of his
daughters, reserving a dose for himself; and on a signal from the old
gentleman, the two young ladies swallowed the nauseous stuff they had
so earnestly solicited.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Mithridates, his rash act.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />The poison took effect at once upon the females; but their father
experienced only a disagreeable taste, without the deadly result he had
looked for. Though too much for two, it was not enough for three, and
the poor old man tottered about in a state of nausea, unattended with
danger. Having been previously tired of existence, he was now
thoroughly sick of it, and turning to a loyal servant at his side, he
requested that he might immediately be put out of his misery. The
faithful fellow, making a compromise between his morality and his duty,
turned away his eyes, and held out the point of his sword, when
Mithridates, coming speedily to the point, fell on the outstretched
weapon.</p>

<p>Thus ended the Mithridatic War, as well as Mithridates himself;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
and his cowardly son Pharnaces sent in his adhesion to Pompey,
acknowledging, in a spirit of humility and subservience to Rome, that
he only held his kingdom at the pleasure of the Senate.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/i_p0287.png" width="340" height="470" alt="Mithridates." title="" />
<span class="caption">Mithridates.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />The character of Mithridates has been drawn by so many different
delineators, that his portrait, as taken by the historians, presents a
daub in which it is difficult to recognise the true features. So many
skilful artists have been employed upon the task, that we hesitate in
submitting Mithridates to a fresh canvassing at our hands; nor are we
desirous of using the pencil, as some have done, for the purpose of
imparting additional blackness. Some of those who have taken the
sketch in hand, have thrown in the shadows with a ten-pound brush,
while others have clothed him in several coats and overcoats of varnish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
for the purpose of glossing over the defects of his character. All are
ready to admit that he was an able ruler; but he had not that perfect
uprightness and straightness which give to a ruler the qualities most to
be desired. He could speak twenty-five different languages; and thus
he was often able to talk over those with whom he might not have been
able to come to an understanding, had his conversation been less
versatile. He was of gigantic stature, which caused him to be looked
up to by those who were placed under his authority. Notwithstanding
his excessive height, he was not at all ungainly in his appearance, but
his well-moulded frame was a perfect picture.</p>

<p>His fondness for the fine arts was exhibited in the rapacity with
which he seized upon the choicest efforts of human genius, which were
in turn stolen from him by other amateurs, whose patronage of talent
was evinced in the ardour with which they appropriated the result of
its labours. In Sinope, one of his cities, was found an astronomical
sphere, which seems to show that the science of the stars was within
the circle of his knowledge. In one of his fortresses was discovered a
statue of himself no less than twelve feet high, in pure gold, which
proved not only the value he set upon himself, but showed how completely
he was wrapped up in the precious metal.</p>

<p>Credit has been given him for the possession of many domestic
virtues; because, though he was cruel to one half of his numerous
wives, he treated the other half with considerate tenderness. He
excited the terror of his foes, but enjoyed the affection of his servants;
and though hated in the field, he was beloved in the kitchen.
According to Paterculus, Mithridates was a man of whom it is difficult
to speak, and still more difficult to say nothing.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The same authority
confers upon him a character for greatness of mind during the whole of
his life; but when, having a great mind to kill himself, he prevailed
on a slave to put him to death, he evinced&mdash;to use a contradictory
expression&mdash;a vast amount of mental littleness.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>CONSPIRACY OF CATILINE. INTRODUCTION OF CICERO. CÆSAR,<br />
POMPEY, CRASSUS, AND CO.<br /><br /></h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 192px;">
<img src="images/i_p0289.png" width="192" height="200" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Republic without republicans may
be an exceptional state of things;
but ancient as well as modern history
furnishes proof that the existence
of a republic is not incompatible
with the absence of anything
for which such a form of government
is usually desired. It is
now an ascertained fact, that the
people have no greater enemies to
liberty than themselves; and that
universal suffrage is the surest
instrument to effect the objects of
a despot. Equality, in a republican
sense, seems to imply a condition
in which all are equally debased; and a nation appears to be
never so thoroughly slavish as when it is free to choose its own ruler.</p>

<p>The Romans had for some time been in the habit of placing themselves
in the hands of a succession of tyrants and knaves, who obtained
popularity by the display of the worst attributes. One would win the
public voice by his boldness as a thief; another would render himself
the elect of the people by his sanguinary successes as a wholesale
murderer. It is unfortunate for what is termed the liberal cause, that
the vulgarest qualities often attract the largest share of applause; and
that those who are entrusted most freely with the confidence of the
people are almost always the most unscrupulous in betraying it.</p>

<p>Rome had now sunk to the lowest condition; and society, under the
republic, had become so dissolute, that its dissolution might be looked
for as a natural consequence. Among the nobles of the period was a
certain mass of cruelty and corruption, under the name of Sergius
Catiline. He boasted of a long line in connection with his family tree;
but a much shorter line, in connection with any ordinary tree, would
have been more appropriate to his merits. Having spent all his own
money, he spent as much as he could of other people's, by running into
debt as deeply as possible. In order to meet some of his old engagements
sufficiently to enable him to contract new, he murdered his
brother, with a few more of his family connections, and, in fact, justified
the opinion formed of him on account of his antecedents, by killing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
relatives. Having obtained a Proprætorship in Africa, he followed up
his career of private swindling, by the wholesale practice of public
robbery. He used his office for the purposes of extortion; and the
only proof he gave of exactness was in the exactions to which he submitted
all who were under his authority.</p>

<p>On his return to Rome he hoped to have a wider scope for his
dishonesty in the office of Consul, to which he aspired; and he formed
a party of ruined spendthrifts, whose only chance of supporting themselves
was by supporting him as a candidate for power. These desperadoes
had nothing to lose, and everything to gain,&mdash;all that they had
to lose being their own, and all that they had to gain being the property
of others. Catiline had attracted the sympathies of these adventurers
by promising to divide among them all the official salaries; and he had
rallied round him a considerable number of adherents by offering to the
"million" an opportunity of helping themselves to that which did not
belong to them. He professed to be able to relieve all classes at once,
by relieving the poor of their burdens, and the rich of their property.
The dregs of the populace were easily stirred up, and even some of the
nominal nobles were base enough to join in a conspiracy against their
own order. The object of the conspiracy was to murder the whole of
the senate by a massacre <i>en masse</i>; but the scheme was frustrated by
that treachery which is almost sure to be found among a set of men
who are banded together for a bad purpose. One Curius was induced
to gratify the curiosity of a woman, named Fulvia, with whom he was
in love; and the secret having reached female ears, flew to the tip of a
female tongue, when the secret oozed out as naturally as water finding
its level.</p>

<p>Cicero, who had been the competitor of Catiline for the Consulship,
soon became aware of the facts; and the former resolved to try and
talk the conspiracy down, by making it the subject of several bursts of
indignant eloquence.</p>

<p>On the entrance of so illustrious a person as Cicero on the historical
scene, it is fit that we should act the part of cicerone, for the purpose
of introducing him. This celebrated character was born on the 3rd of
January, in the year of the City 647, at Arpinum, where his father had
a seat before the future orator was capable of standing. His grandfather
was a man of some consideration, pecuniary as well as moral; for
he was possessed of some property, and looked up to as an authority in
questions of local politics. He had two sons, the eldest of whom,
Marcus, was the father of the celebrated Marcus Tullius, from whom
the family has derived that indelible mark which time is not likely to
obliterate. After receiving the rudiments of his education at his native
place, he was sent to Rome, where he studied Greek; and the flame of
oratory was first kindled in his mind by contact with the Greek poetic
fire. As soon as he had assumed the toga, he became wrapped up in
manly pursuits, and was placed under the care of Mucius Scævola, the
augur, who augured extremely well of his pupil. The young Cicero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
soon evinced a turn for poetry, which caused his head to be constantly
running upon poetical feet; and he came out rather strong in numbers
at a very early period. At the appointed age he joined the army; for
the laws of his country required that on his entrance into life he should
incur the risk of being sent out of it. He was present in the Marsic
War, at the taking of the Samnite camp; but being in-tent on another
part of the field, he saw little of the battle. At the end of the war he
devoted himself to literary pursuits, and wrote his work <i>De Inventione</i>,
which, in accordance with the maxim that necessity is the mother of
invention, no doubt derived its existence from the author's <a name="necessities" id="necessities"></a>necessities.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;">
<img src="images/i_p0291.png" width="392" height="450" alt="Fulvia." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fulvia.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />He next studied the art of reasoning, under Diodorus, who came to
live under Cicero's roof, so that the latter probably found, or rather
provided, lodging, while the Stoic "stood" the logic, which was
undoubtedly a reasonable consideration for the accommodation afforded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
him. In his twenty-sixth year Cicero came out regularly as a professed
orator; and the public voice soon accorded to his own a reputation of
the highest character.</p>

<p>After talking incessantly for nearly two years, he found it necessary
to take breath in retirement; and proceeded to Athens and to Rhodes,
where he cultivated a more subdued style of oratory, getting rid of a
disagreeable redundancy of action, and avoiding that motion, of course,
of the arms, which is the common defect of the youthful advocate.</p>

<p>On his return to Rome, after an absence of two years, he appeared
in the courts of law with distinguished success, and had the next best
business to those popular leaders, Cotta and Hortensius. The three
learned brethren were all of them successful candidates for the offices of
Consul and Quæstor, in the last of which capacity Cicero was sent to
Sicily. There his chief employment was to keep up a good supply of
wheat for the capital, and, by the production of large crops of corn, he
cultivated his growing popularity. During his Quæstorship he visited
Syracuse, and discovered the tomb of Archimedes, which was thoroughly
overgrown with briers, presenting an apt monument to one who had
trodden, during life, the thorny paths of science. Cicero left the
island with the pleasing idea that all Rome had been resounding with
the praises of his administration; but, on landing at Puteoli, he was
not a little disgusted at meeting a friend who asked him "where he had
been, and what was the latest news in the city?" Cicero, at once perceiving
that out of sight and out of mind were the same thing, determined
to keep himself henceforth in the public eye to prevent its being
shut to his merits.</p>

<p>It was not long after this period of his history that he came into
collision with the conspirator, Catiline, whom he denounced before the
assembled Senate, in an oration which has been preserved to this day,
by the pungency of its sarcastic reasoning. Every sentence smacked of
Attic salt, and every word was so much pepper to the guilty Catiline.
The latter attempted a reply; but the senators were seized simultaneously
with one of those coughs which spread like an influenza over an
unwilling audience. The mask was now fairly torn off; and Catiline
stood revealed in all his naturally atrocious features. He fled from
Rome; but Cicero continued to show that though his hostility was all
talk, it was of the most effective kind; for he sent forth speech after
speech, and every sentence involved a sentence of "guilty" against Catiline.
All those conspirators who had remained in Rome were seized, and
strangled by the executioner, who, when they cried for pity, abruptly
choked their <a name="utterance" id="utterance"></a>utterance.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i_p0292b.png" width="550" height="336" alt="Cicero denouncing Catiline." title="" />
<span class="caption">Cicero denouncing Catiline.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />The conspiracy, though in great part stifled, was not wholly extinguished;
for Catiline did his utmost to keep it alive, by assembling an
army in Etruria. There he was to have been opposed by the Consul,
C. Antonius; but that individual pleaded illness, and declared that a
severe headache would preclude him from encountering the din of war,
while a hoarseness, which he said had seized him by the throat, incapacitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
him, as he alleged, for giving the word of command on the
field of battle. His troops were, however, so determined on action,
that they no sooner heard of their general being an invalid, than they
insisted that his appointment was invalidated, and they proceeded to
business under the command of his legate, M. Petreius. A fierce
battle ensued, at Pistoria, and both sides fought like lions; though, to
say he fought like a tiger would have been more appropriate to one of
the race of Cati-line. Nobody fled, if the accounts are to be believed;
but 3000 conspirators fell with their swords in their hands, causing
a perfect mountain of slain; and, to crown the whole, their leader
is alleged to have formed the summit of this cadaverous pyramid.
Those of the conspirators who were not killed by the sword were suffocated
under the heaps of their companions; and the conspiracy itself
was effectually smothered.</p>

<p>Cicero having saved his country, went out of office,&mdash;a course exactly
opposite to that followed by modern statesmen, who sometimes quit the
service of their country when they have placed it in danger. He
received the thanks of the Senate; was hailed as Pater Patriæ, the
father of his country, and was invested with a civic crown,&mdash;a head-dress
of oak-leaves; the material being a fitting type of that popularity
which falls away and is scattered to the winds with such fatal facility.</p>

<p>The fickleness of public favour was speedily shown in the case of
Cicero; for it was proposed that Pompey should be recalled from Asia,
to restore the Constitution; it being one of the inconveniences of a
republic, that though the constitution is said to be always the best in
the world, it is always in need of a succession of restoratives. Pompey
landed at Brundusium, where he disbanded all his army, in order to
show his attachment to republican simplicity,&mdash;a term which is often
misapplied; for the simplicity of republicans consists chiefly in their
aptitude for being imposed upon.</p>

<p>Though Pompey arrived at Rome without his soldiers, he took care
to show his grateful sense of services to come, by causing every man of
them to receive a sum equal to about forty-five pounds sterling from the
public treasury. He devoted a portion of his gains to building a temple,
ostensibly to Minerva, but, in reality, dedicated to himself; for it was
inscribed with an account of his victories.</p>

<p>Having sought in vain the support of the Senate, he abandoned the
aristocratic party, and threw himself upon the people, who received him
with open arms; but the arms that are open to admit a candidate for
popularity are often equally open to let him fall from his position.</p>

<p>As Pompey is destined to lose his life before the end of the chapter,
it may be as well to give some account of his birth, that the reader may
be able to estimate the loss at its true value.</p>

<p>Pompeius Cneius was born on the 30th of September, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 106, a few
months later than Cicero, and breathed his first at about the time when
Jugurtha breathed his last, in a Roman prison. The family of Pompey
belonged to the plebs; and one of his ancestors may be said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
lived upon air, for he was by profession a flute-player. His father,
Pompeius Strabo, had imbibed aristocratic ideas, and fought in the
Marsic War; but he seems to have despised the laurel of fame for the
more profitable branch of plunder. His wealth had been considerable;
and after his death his son was accused of having participated in the
ill-gotten gains, when young Pompey, knowing the corruption of the
tribunals, married the daughter of the judge, as a sure mode of getting
a decision in his favour.</p>

<p>His acquittal followed as a matter of course; for when public officials
were immersed in every kind of selfishness and degradation, the sinking
of the judge in the father-in-law was comparatively venial. By dishonest
means the elder Pompey had come to a great estate, from a low condition;
and the son sought to hide, in the abundance of his means, the
meanness of his origin. He became proud and upstart, evincing a predilection
for aristocracy, which often animates those of lofty talent and
low birth; who frequently affect the littlenesses of the nominally great,
instead of showing that true greatness can exist among the so-called
little. Self aggrandisement was his grand, or rather his petty, object;
and he owes to his ignoble attempts to elevate himself, the low place he
occupies in the opinion of the impartial historian.</p>

<p>Soon after his return from Asia to Rome, he celebrated a triumph,
which had all the attributes of a vulgar puff; for there were carried
before him long lists of his achievements, followed by several wagon-loads
of goods, the produce of much pillage. Finding his political
designs opposed by Cato and others, he was anxious to form a party of
his own; and C. J. Cæsar, who saw the necessities of Pompey, determined
on turning them to his own advantage. He made overtures, to
which the other listened, and effected a reconciliation between Pompey
and Crassus, who having both met, were capable of contributing in more
senses than one to the success of the plans of Cæsar. These three
men entered into a sort of political union, which is usually distinguished
by the name of The First Triumvirate.</p>

<p>Cæsar had become Consul in the year of the City 694, (<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 59) when
the party of the Senate, wishing to have a check upon him, practised
every sort of bribery to obtain the election of one Bibulus as his
colleague. This individual was a mere nobody, with a remarkable
deficiency of head; and the small wits of the day were accustomed to
date their notes "in the Consulship of Julius and Cæsar," instead of in
the Consulship of Cæsar and Bibulus.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that despotism always looks for its tools
among those whom it designs for its victims; and there are no instruments
so ready as the people themselves to put an end to popular liberty.
It is the policy of a tyrant to destroy all power but his own; and the
destruction of legal authority is always favourable to those who are
playing the game of unprincipled ambition. Cæsar began by flattering
the people at the expense of the Senate; and he enacted that records
of the proceedings of the latter should be published under the title of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
<i>Acta Diurna</i>, which may be regarded as the origin of our journals of the
House of Commons, and our daily newspapers. A second measure was
a sort of Insolvent Act, for the benefit of the farmers of the public
revenue, who, in their anxiety to obtain the contract, had offered more
than they could pay for the privilege of collecting the taxes. His third
great project was an agrarian law, in conformity with which any pauper
citizen who could show at least three children&mdash;whether genuine, or
borrowed for the occasion, it might have been difficult to ascertain&mdash;were
entitled to a grant of land in Campania. This premium on
improvident marriages called forth such an overwhelming demonstration
of paternity, that the ground in Campania fell far short of the
quantity of fatherland that was required; and it was necessary to purchase
several thousands of acres, in order to widen the field for the
operations of Cæsar. Bibulus opposed the measure; but his opposition,
though for the moment busy, proved idle in the end; when, disgusted
with failure, he shut himself up in his house for the rest of the year;
and every one said that he had been completely shut up by his more
powerful colleague.</p>

<p>Cæsar was now more desirous than ever of a near alliance with
Pompey; and, in order to draw the bands closer, the former gave his
daughter in marriage to the latter, though the gentleman was obliged to
put away his old wife, Mucia, to make room for the new; and the lady,
Julia, was under the necessity of breaking off an engagement with an
intended husband. In order to constitute a strong family party for
carrying on the government, Cæsar himself married Calpurnia, the
daughter of L. Calpurnius Piso, who, by means of private influence, was
made consul for the ensuing year with A. Gabinus.</p>

<p>It was customary for a retiring Consul to have a province assigned to
him for a single year; but Cæsar having worked all the principal public
departments with tools of his own, obtained, by a flagrant violation of the
Constitution, a prolonged lease of his own power. The rich provinces
of Cisalpine Gaul and Illyrium were assigned to him for five years;
and Transalpine Gaul was afterwards added by the Senate, because
they saw the people were so completely under his influence, that they
would either have given him all he asked, or he would have taken all
he wanted without asking it.</p>

<p>Among the members of the aristocracy of this degenerate age of the
Roman republic was one Clodius, whose name, like himself, was a corruption
of Claudius, for he belonged to the family of the Claudii.
This disreputable profligate had obtained an infamous notoriety during
the festival of the <i>Bona Dea</i>, whose rites were celebrated on the first of
May; and being conducted exclusively by women, the ceremony was no
doubt one of a most confused and tedious character. Clodius having disguised
himself in a female dress, passed unnoticed amid the din of many
tongues, till female curiosity detected him in a flirtation with the wife
of Cæsar, whose house was the scene of the festival. Clodius was
brought to trial for the offence, and sent a retainer to Cicero, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
instructions to the orator to prove an <i>alibi</i>. Instead of following the
modern professional course of adopting any falsehood, however gross,
for the sake of a client, Cicero hurried into the opposite extreme, and,
indignantly throwing up his brief, not only rushed into the witness-box
to give evidence against the accused, but threw up his cause in an
explosive burst of eloquence. Notwithstanding this remarkable instance
of honesty at the bar, there was so much corruption on the bench, that
Clodius bribed the judge by throwing into the scales of justice a sum of
gold which turned the balance in his favour. Clodius threatened
revenge, and promised to stick to Cicero through life, for having cast
him off, and refused to stick to him at such a momentous crisis.<br /><br /></p>

<span class="caption">Cicero throws up his Brief, like a Gentleman.</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br />Cæsar, who was the person most interested in the subject of the lawsuit,
allowed it to give him very little uneasiness; for having divorced
his wife, he continued on terms of friendship with Clodius. The latter
became a candidate for the tribuneship; but being disqualified by his
high birth, he got himself adopted into that for which nature had best
adapted him&mdash;a very low family. By a bargain with the Consuls he
obtained their support; for he promised that if they helped him to the
tribuneship, he would assist them in helping themselves to a rich
province at the close of their year of office. The disgraceful arrangement
was completed,&mdash;the plunderers paying each other at the cost of
the public welfare.</p>

<p>Clodius immediately began to exercise his public authority for the
gratification of his private feelings; and got a law passed for the sole
purpose of destroying Cicero. The orator looked to the triumvirate
for protection; but Pompey went out of town; Crassus remembered an
old grudge; and Cæsar sided with his friend Clodius. Cicero, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
waiting to take his trial, left the city, amid the lamentations of all the
good, who formed a mourning party, far more select than numerous.
After his departure, sentence of outlawry was passed upon him; his
house on the Palatine, and his two villas, were by the hand of demolition
brought to the ground, while the rest of his property was brought
to the hammer at a public auction.</p>

<p>Clodius having been successful in the gratification of one of his
personal animosities, began to look about for other victims against
whom he could put in force the power with which "the people" had
entrusted him. Recollecting that he had once been in the hands of
pirates, and that Ptolemy, King of Cyprus, had declined to rescue him,
he passed a law that Ptolemy should be at once deposed; and he, in
order to kill two unfortunate birds with one stone, got rid of Cato,
by sending him to take possession of Cyprus as a Roman province.
Ptolemy, instead of meeting the matter with spirit, met it with a dose
of laudanum, and so far forgot himself as to seek in suicide forgetfulness
of his sorrows.</p>

<p>Cicero employed his exile in lamenting his fate; and though by
profession a dealer in philosophy, he had no stock on hand for his own
use, when its consolation was required. He sent whining letters to his
wife; and his signature was so bedewed with tears, that he left a blot
upon his name, through his unmanly weakness.</p>

<p>Clodius being no longer Consul, a portion of the incubus which
stifled the breath of freedom was removed, and the public voice ventured
so make itself heard in demanding the recall of Cicero. The orator
returned in triumph; and he showed his gratitude by supporting any
measure that was proposed by any of those who had been influential in
bringing him home again. His advocacy was demanded, and freely
given, in favour of many a disgraceful proceeding on the part of his
friends; and he undertook the defence of Gabinius, who had carried on
a system of extortion in Syria.</p>

<p>Rome was now completely in the hands of an ambitious party, which,
by means of armed mercenaries, disposed of the lives, the liberties, and
even the opinions of the citizens. Pompey and Crassus, at the instigation
of Cæsar, put up for the Consulship a second time, when an opposition
candidate, L. Domitius, having come forward, his servant was cut
down by the soldiers before his face, as a hint to those who should
presume to hold an opinion adverse to the existing authority. The
candidate having seen the skull of his domestic split, feared an equally
decisive plumper for his own poll, and retired into private life, leaving
the executive to be re-elected without any attempt at opposition. The
temporary powers of each member of the triumvirate were, by treachery
and violence, prolonged for five years; and Cato, who ventured on an
opinion that the step was not quite in accordance with the constitution
or the law, was unceremoniously thrown into prison. Right was in all
cases made completely subservient to might; and the competitors for
power kept armed ruffians in their pay, whose collisions with each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
other were often of the most desperate character. In one of these
encounters between the creatures of Clodius and the mercenaries of
Milo, the former was killed, which caused the latter to be put upon his
trial. Cicero was engaged to defend the accused; but Pompey, who
hated Milo, had taken care to surround the former with an armed
force, which so intimidated Cicero, that his tongue stuck to his mouth,
when he himself ought to have stuck to his client. The orator had not
a word to say for himself, or rather for Milo; and as not a sentence
was said in his favour, a sentence was pronounced against him. He
went into exile at Marseilles; and Cicero, with tardy zeal, wrote a
defence when the trial was over. He sent a copy of it to Milo, who
pronounced it excellent in its way, but a little too late; and he added,
in writing to Cicero, "If you had only delivered it in time, you would
have delivered me from the dilemma I was placed in."<br /><br /></p>

<h3>OVERTHROW OF CRASSUS. DEFEAT OF POMPEY. DICTATORSHIP AND DEATH<br />
OF CÆSAR. END OF THE ROMAN REPUBLIC.<br /><br /></h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 185px;">
<img src="images/i_p0299.png" width="185" height="250" alt="" title="" />
</div>


<p><span style="margin-left:-0.5em" class="smcap">æsar's</span> proceedings in Gaul are sufficiently
familiar to enable us to treat them with
a sort of contempt, by omitting even the
heads of the oft-repeated tale from our
history. Though his arms were abroad,
his eye was at home, and he watched the
affairs of Rome with a jealous interest.
His confederates, Pompey and Crassus,
had quarrelled; and the former fell out
with Cæsar; so that there was a difference
between the triumvirate, though
they were all three alike in their unscrupulous
designs upon the commonwealth.</p>

<p>Crassus was busy in his province of
Syria, laying his hands on every thing
of any value, until somebody laid hands upon him, notwithstanding
his worthlessness. His engagement with the Parthians was a short
passage in his life, which led to his death; for he had been induced by
treachery to plunge into the mess of the Mesopotamian deserts. There
he encountered an army which endeavoured to strike terror into the
Romans, by brayings, bellowings, the beating of drums, and every kind
of hollow artifice. The Parthians, who were skilful in the use of the
bow, sent forth such a shower of arrows, that fury darted into many an
eye, and on many a lip there was a quiver. Crassus began to faint,
and went into a sort of hysterics, highly incompatible with historic
dignity. The enemy, however, tried a feint of a different kind, and
pretended to run away; but when pursued, turned suddenly round,
galloped upon the Romans through a sand-hill, thus raising so much
dust, that the latter were obliged to lick it, as their mouths were full of
it. In this position they were assailed with arrows, which having been
shot at their feet, pinned many of them to the ground; and their
hands being skewered in the same manner to their breasts, they could
neither fly nor defend themselves.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The horses might still have
charged; but when the poor creatures arrived at the Parthian pikes,
they were obliged to pull up rather suddenly. The cavalry being cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
to pieces, Crassus and some of his footmen retired to a sand-hill for
safety; but they soon found the error of building their hopes on such a
foundation. Crassus himself hid his head in the sand, and would see
nobody; but ultimately he was induced to enter into a negotiation with
the Parthian general. In the course of the parley a little misunderstanding
arose, when some of the parties present began to push each
other about, first with their hands, then with their clenched fists, and
ultimately with their weapons. At length Octavius, who had accompanied
Crassus, drew his sword, and killed a groom, when somebody
else killed Octavius; and the assassination having once fairly&mdash;or
unfairly&mdash;set in, Crassus himself was soon disposed of. The King of
the Parthians caused the head of Crassus to be filled with gold, as in
his lifetime he had devoted all his faculties to the accumulation of
the metal.</p>

<p>By the death of Crassus, the triumvirate was reduced to a duumvirate,
and jealousies arose between Pompey and Cæsar; but as the people
seemed to think that two heads at loggerheads were better than one
having everything its own way, the opposing tyrants were left by the
public to fight their own battles. The great prize for which they were
now contending was the army, which is too often exposed to the degradation
of being reckoned upon as the sure means of crushing everything
in the shape of law and liberty.</p>

<p>Cæsar had certainly obtained the attachment of his soldiers; for he
had shared their dangers; but the vain upstart, Pompey, had no more
claim upon the army than he could establish by corrupting them.
Cæsar held them by their affections, but Pompey hoped to unite them
to him by those golden links which never fix themselves to the heart,
though effecting a sort of temporary hanging-on to the pocket. Cæsar
stood on the bank of the Rubicon, which divided his province of Gaul
from Italy, and, looking at the surface of the river, he was soon
absorbed in his own reflections. He knew it was against the law to
cross the stream with an army; but after looking at both sides, and
feeling his position to be that of sink or swim, he made a bold plunge,
with one of his legions after him. The Rubicon was now passed; and
Pompey, hearing of Cæsar's approach, was struck with such a panic
before he had received any real blow, that he had at once quitted the
city. So great was his haste, that he omitted even to follow his natural
bent, and went away without robbing the treasury. The tyrant is so
frequently associated in the same person with the coward, that the
ignoble retreat of Pompey was the natural sequel to his previous despotism;
for that which passes for boldness of action may be prompted
by the fears of the knave, instead of by the courage of the hero.</p>

<p>Cæsar arrived at Rome, which had become freed from the presence of
one tyrant, to receive another; and the people certainly deserved all
they got, or rather all they lost; for they conferred upon the despot
many marks of popularity. When he wanted money, he burst open the
treasury-door like a thief; and when opposed in the name of the law, he
cut down everything in the shape of objection, like a <a name="butcher" id="butcher"></a>butcher.<br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 412px;">
<img src="images/i_p0301.png" width="412" height="450" alt="&quot;Quid times? Cæsarem vehis.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Quid times? Cæsarem vehis.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><br /><br /><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>Cæsar next proceeded to Spain, but only to be recalled as Dictator, to
which office he had been illegally nominated by one of his creatures,
the Prætor, M. Lepidus. Having laid down the dictatorship in eleven
days, during which period he laid down the law on some very important
questions, including that of debtor and creditor, Cæsar abandoned his
legislative pursuits, and started in pursuit of Pompey. The latter had
proceeded to Greece, where the former suffered much inconvenience in
trying to manage the movements of his army. Only a portion of his
troops having got across the water, he became so impatient at the non-arrival
of the rest, that he went to see after them by going to sea
himself in disguise, on board a small fishing-boat. The winds were
extremely contrary, and were blowing the vessel back, with a force
threatening to dismast her, and to the utmost dismay of the master,
when Cæsar, who was sitting at the stern, put on a stern look, exclaiming,
"<i>Quid times? Cæsarem vehis.</i>" "What are you afraid
of? You carry Cæsar as a passenger." At this moment the vessel
gave a lurch, and the heels of Cæsar were suddenly brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
the level at which his head had the moment before been visible.
The mariner was about to ask for further explanation, and had got
"<i>Quid?</i>" in his mouth, when a wave completely washed him up, and
he remained in soak for the rest of the voyage. The vessel was driven
back, and Cæsar, who was wet through, as well as in despair, sat
wringing alternately his hands and his toga.</p>

<p>At length, soon after his return to his camp, his army was brought
to him by Antony; but provisions were so scarce, that the soldiers had
to live upon bark, which proves that the unlucky "dogs of war" were
exposed to the most biting necessities. There, however, they continued,
without being subdued; and, indeed, the bark seems to have made
them more than usually snappish; for they threw some of it into the
hostile camp, and declared they would live upon grass; nor would they
lay down their swords while there was a single blade remaining.</p>

<p>Cæsar encountered some slight reverses, and took up his quarters at
Pharsalia, where he might have been blocked in and starved out, had
not Pompey been taunted into attacking him. Cæsar was delighted at
that imprudence, the fruits of which were speedily shown; for Pompey's
army was utterly routed; and Pompey himself, retreating to his tent,
was literally sick at the disgusting result of his enterprise. "The
way in which my soldiers turned their backs," exclaimed Pompey to an
intimate friend, "has positively turned my stomach;" and he was only
sufficiently recovered on the following day to start <i>viâ</i> Lesbos for
Egypt. There ill-fortune still awaited him; for Ptolemy, the young
king, instead of receiving the outcast with hospitality, was advised to
put him to death, as a little compliment to Cæsar. Septimius, a Roman,
who had served under Pompey, was sent to meet him, with instructions
to stab him in the back; and the victim had no sooner felt the blow,
than, according to the custom of the period, he arranged the folds of his
robe across his face, so that although very disgracefully killed, he might
very gracefully expire. His wife, Cornelia, who witnessed the scene,
sailed away as fast as she could from the melancholy sight, leaving no
one but an old servant, named Philip, to perform not only the funeral,
but all the characters that the performance required. He was, in fact,
the undertaker of the whole of the sad ceremony, and attended as sole
mourner at the melancholy undertaking.</p>

<p>On the arrival of Cæsar in Egypt, he was welcomed by having the
head of Pompey put into his hand; but the former turned away in
disgust, and at once dropped his old animosity.</p>

<p>Being detained by contrary winds at Alexandria, Cæsar entered into
the disputes between Cleopatra and her elder brother Ptolemy; when
the young lady, relying on her powers of fascination, caused herself to
be brought, concealed in a mattress,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> into the presence of the Roman
general. Having emerged from under the bed, she pleaded her cause
so earnestly, that he went to war on her account with her brother, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
ultimately fell into the water; thus causing the drowning of himself
and all his enmity. Cleopatra reigned in Egypt; and Cæsar was so
enslaved by her charms, that he remained nine months on a visit; nor
would he have torn himself away, but for the intelligence that
Pharnaces, the son of Mithridates, was endeavouring to recover his
father's lost possessions. Hurrying to Pontus, he looked out for the
enemy, drew his sword, struck one decisive blow, and in the memorable
words, "<i>Veni, vidi, vici,</i>" he set an example of the laconic style, which
no writer of military despatches has since followed.</p>

<p>Disturbances had by this time broken out at Rome; and in order to
repair the evil, Cæsar was obliged to repair himself to the capital. So
much enthusiasm had been excited by the battle of Pharsalia&mdash;for the
people are always too ready to lick the hand which seems capable of
striking them&mdash;that Cæsar had been elected Dictator for one year,
Consul for five, and Tribune for his whole lifetime.</p>

<p>The fact is, that Rome had become so thoroughly tired of the continual
contests for the chief power, which a republican form of
government necessarily invites, that the nation yearned for a permanent
head, and eagerly adopted the very first that offered. It was thought
better to be the slaves of one despotic adventurer, than the victims of
half-a-dozen; and even absolutism was preferred to the republican
system, which had kept the country so long exposed to laceration at the
hands of those who were trying to snatch it from each other, without
being able to govern it.</p>

<p>After a short stay in Rome, during which he exhibited his power by
making various arbitrary changes in the Law and Constitution&mdash;for it is
the tendency of a republic to place a whole nation at the will of one man&mdash;Cæsar
proceeded to Africa, with the view of quelling there the party
opposed to him. He marched against Utica, which was governed by
Cato, who, when he ought to have been preparing to fight, was standing
upon ceremony, and politely insisting that Scipio ought to take the
command, as being the man of the highest rank present. Scipio, who
was not ambitious of the foremost place in the field, declared that
the pretended deference to his rank was rank nonsense, and that Cato
must assume his proper position. The Governor, however, persisted;
and Scipio went forth to fight; but he seems to have killed nobody
except himself, while Juba and the legate Petreius, two other brave
fellows on the same side, slew each other.</p>

<p>Cato, trembling for the fate of Utica, called a meeting of the Senate,
which resolved unanimously to run away; and the Governor went home
to supper. On retiring to his chamber he called for his sword, which
was nowhere to be found; and he became so irritated, that he savagely
struck the domestic who returned without the missing weapon. At
length it turned out that "one of the young gentlemen had got it;"
for the sword was brought to Cato by his eldest son, and it was quietly
put away for the night under the old gentleman's pillow. Cato went to
bed, and fell asleep while reading one of Plato's dialogues. Waking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
again at dawn, he rose, and having methodically finished the perusal of
the dialogue he had commenced over-night, he ran himself through the
body. His attendants rushed in, and sewed up the wound; but they
had no sooner turned their backs, than&mdash;if we are to believe the authorities,
which we confess we cannot at all times&mdash;he either undid
the numerous stitches in his side, or ran himself through the body
again; and, with a compliment in his mouth to the excellence of the
reasoning of Plato, expired.</p>

<p>Cato was only eight-and-forty at the time of his death; and therefore,
though in the course of nature too young to die, he was quite old
enough to have known better than to kill himself. The graver historians
inform us, that "he died the death of a hero and a philosopher;"
but being unable to appreciate the heroism of running away from misfortune,
instead of meeting it, or the philosophy of refusing to endure
what one cannot cure, we must beg to be allowed to differ from the
serious writers, who generally hold up suicide as a subject for respect
and admiration. Cæsar was, of course, deeply affected on hearing of
Cato's decease; but such affectation was common in those days; and
there was nothing extraordinary in Cæsar's having gone into mourning
for the man whose death he had long been compassing.</p>

<p>The victorious general now returned to Rome, where he might have
obtained as long a lease as he pleased of almost unlimited power. He
was named Dictator for ten years; and, instead of pursuing the ordinary
practice of tyranny, which abuses the greatest power to gratify the
pettiest spite, Cæsar not only made no proscriptions, but declared a
general amnesty. He celebrated four triumphs, and gave a succession
of banquets; for he knew that there is no more portentous grumbling
than that which proceeds from an empty stomach.</p>

<p>Being entrusted with supreme power, he turned it, in many instances,
to good account; and introduced, among other wholesome regulations, the
very valuable reform of the Roman Calendar. This was an improvement,
not merely for the day, but for all time, and has handed down the name
of its author to every age, and every civilised country, in every almanack.</p>

<p>In these and similar salutary occupations he was disturbed by an
insurrection in Spain, headed by the two sons of Pompey, Cneius and
Sextus, whom he encountered, on Saturday, the 17th of March,
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 45, on the field of Munda. The battle, though ultimately decisive,
was at first doubtful; for Cæsar's troops had commenced retreating, when
their want of spirit so dispirited him, that, as they ran away, he was
near making away with himself, by the mere force of sympathy. By a
last effort, however, he succeeded in stopping the fugitives, and asked
them if they were mad, to display such flightiness. His appeal was
successful; and, having first come to themselves, they fell upon the
enemy. Cneius made for the shore, and was getting into a ship, when
a rope caught his foot, and he remained tied by the leg in a most
perilous position. Having endeavoured for some time to effect his own
extrication from the cable, which proved utterly impracti-cable, he called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
to one of his companions, who endeavoured to cut the rope, and in
doing so, wounded Cneius. The unhappy sufferer attempted to fly,
but being pursued to within an inch of his life, he naturally had not a
foot to spare; and finding himself deprived of the use of one of his legs;
he was, of course, in a sad hobble. He had got on shore, and had just
placed his foot in a doctor's hands, when he was overtaken and killed
by the enemy. His brother Sextus made his escape; and his hopes of
rulership being at an end, he commenced the trade of a robber, which is
not a very different kind of business from that of government in the
days of military despotism.</p>

<p>On Cæsar's return to Rome he was received with increased adulation,
though his victory had been over the Romans themselves; who, by
acquiescing in their own degradation, became fully deserving of all the
acts of tyranny they were made the victims of. Success, however, is
the idol to which the multitude will bow, let the object of adoration be
either good or evil; and it is only when the latter encounters the fall,
which, sooner or later, must be its inevitable fate, that the <i>Vox Dei</i> is
really echoed by the <i>Vox Populi</i>.</p>

<p>We must, however, accept with caution the accounts of the rejoicings
that are described as attending the dictatorship of one who had so completely
subjugated his country, that murder or banishment, without trial,
had become the certain fate of every one who should venture to express
the smallest disapprobation of any of his measures. Nothing is easier
than for one who has a drawn sword ready for every hostile throat, to
style himself the "father of his country," and to exercise the ancient
privilege of paternity by taking the lives of such of his children as
might rebel against his parental authority. It was easy to decree a
thanksgiving of fifty days, and to obtain its outward observance, when
instant death at the hands of a mercenary might be the fate of any one
expressing a doubt as to having much to be grateful for. The statues of
the usurper were placed in all the temples; but this was no test of true
popularity; for if an armed band should break into our house, take
forcible possession of all its contents, rob us of all we possess, and spend
a portion of the proceeds in placing a bust of the head of the banditti in
our principal apartments, it would be no proof of his being a favourite
of ours. He decreed himself imperator, or Emperor, for life,&mdash;a proceeding
no less impudent than that of a burglar, who, having broken
into our premises, calls himself the landlord of the property. He
declared his own person sacred&mdash;a poor consolation for a tyrant who
knows that there is a curse which must eventually be brought terribly
down upon all injustice and iniquity. He seized upon half the
magistracies, as his own private property, to be given away by himself;
and he virtually seized upon the other half, by claiming the nomination
of the candidates. He was, in fact, supreme and sole master of the
Republic; and without any one of the conditions which are absolutely
essential to the permanency of power. His usurpation had neither
law, morality, justice, nor reason&mdash;nor even that hollowest of all
mockeries, expediency&mdash;to rest upon. The first utterance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
public voice, when free to speak, must have overwhelmed him with one
shout of indignant execration; and the first movement of the popular
arm, when freed from its ignoble paralysis, must have hurled him from
power.</p>

<p>Some supporters of the miserable and unprincipled fallacy, that the
end justifies the means, have pointed to some of Cæsar's salutary acts,
as an excuse for his usurpation; but that right can never result from
wrong, is shown in the fate which the Dictator soon met with. His
aim was evidently the monarchy; and his adherent, Antony, caused a
statue of Cæsar to be crowned; when two Tribunes seeing the diadem,
and perceiving that there was an intention of trying it on, ordered it to
be taken off again. The Dictator of the republic was so offended at
this outrage on the symbols of monarchy, that he was on the point of
putting the Tribunes to death, when it was suggested to him that
exile might do as well, and he accordingly sent them into banishment.</p>

<p>It is one of the numerous penalties of iniquity, that its own
example may be followed in opposition to itself; and that he who uses
lawlessness and violence to attain his ends, may find them conducing to
his own, in a sense he had not expected. The sentiments which, in
contact with the open air of freedom, form the wholesome breath of
public opinion, can never be stifled and pent up, without generating the
foul and dangerous vapours of conspiracy. This noxious poison speedily
forms itself among an enslaved people, and an explosion eventually
takes place, which removes a load of oppression, and clears the political
atmosphere.</p>

<p>A conspiracy had been for some time forming against Cæsar's life;
and a band of about sixty, headed by M. Brutus and C. Cassius, had
resolved on his downfall. The Dictator kept continually aiming at the
crown, which he might perhaps have worn in dignity and safety, had he
sought to gain it by honest means; for the nation had become so
heartily sick of the alternate farce and tragedy of a Republic, that the
necessity for some permanent authority based on law was on all hands
admitted. He had, however, tried to effect his object by the cunning
of a knave, the audacity of a thief, and the inhumanity of a butcher.</p>

<p>When a sovereign is really wanted, much may be done for a candidate
who has circumstances, seconded by prudence, honour, and ability, on
his side; but that crown is not worth an hour's purchase which is
seized by force, fraud, and cruelty. The last trick of Cæsar, in trying
to turn his usurpation into a right, was a pretence that the Sibylline
books, having declared the Parthians could be conquered by none but a
king, it was necessary to make him one. The Senate was to meet to
consider the matter, on the 15th of March, in Pompey's Curia, where
now stands the Palazzo Massimi. The professional augurs had already
begun to prophesy, on the strength of those shadows which precede
coming events; and Cæsar was so puffed up with self-conceit, and the
people had been so long his abject slaves, that he had almost learned
to believe the world would never throw off the atom that had got to the
top of it. His wife had, it is said, an unfavourable dream, on the day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
previous to the meeting; but Cæsar smiled at her warnings, and told
her that her night-mare proceeded from some ridiculous mare's nest.
Cæsar walked down to the house of assembly, chatting arm-in-arm with
the Consul, Decimus Brutus. Seeing in the crowd an augur, who had
told him to beware of the Ides of March, Cæsar observed, smiling,
"Well, here they are; and here am I;" to which, "Wait till they are
gone, and then where are you?" was the only reply of the soothsayer.</p>

<p>The secret of the conspiracy, which had been hitherto well kept, now
began to ooze out in all directions; and nearly everybody that Cæsar
met thrust a paper into his hand, or dropped a whisper into his ear;
but he would read and listen to nothing.</p>

<p>The Senators rose on his entrance; and when he took his seat the
conspirators got round about him, until one of them, Metellus
Cimber, came rather intrusively to close quarters, with a petition.
Cæsar gave him a slight push, as a hint to him to keep his distance;
and Cimber, as if to catch himself, took hold of the Dictator's toga,
which was the signal agreed upon. Casca instantly stabbed him in the
neck, when Cassius followed up the blow with a poke in the ribs; and
Brutus had raised his hand with a dagger in it, when Cæsar exclaiming,
"<i>Et tu, Brute!</i>"&mdash;And you!&mdash;you, Brute!&mdash;staggered to the foot of
Pompey's statue, that he might form a <i>tableau</i> as he expired.</p>

<p>The republic was now virtually, if not nominally, at an end, though
a faint struggle was still made by the murderers of Cæsar, who ran
through the streets, proclaiming that they had killed a king, but
obtained no praise for the achievement. Antony, on the other hand,
created an immense sensation, by exhibiting the identical toga in
which Cæsar had fallen, and thrusting his ten fingers through twice as
many large holes, which he declared had been made by the assassins'
daggers. Not satisfied with making the most of Cæsar's wardrobe,
Antony appropriated the money of the deceased; and while the widow
was wrapped in grief, with her face buried in her hands, her late
husband's friend was carrying off all he could lay his hands upon.
Antony had been at once grasping and prodigal, giving away with one
hand what he had snatched with the other; and buying at a liberal
price what he had no means of paying for.</p>

<p>His rival in the contest for the supreme power was Octavius, the
son of a daughter of Cæsar's sister, and who, with no other qualification
than that of nephew to his uncle, had the impudence to claim absolute
dominion over a great but broken-spirited nation. This individual was
without character or courage; and though afraid to be left in the dark,
he was still more afraid of the light; for he felt that his own actions
would not bear looking at. His cowardice had the usual effect upon
him, for it made him cruel; and though there was nothing but his
name to make him a favourite with the army, he had betrayed the
soldiers into the disgrace of turning their arms on their fellow-citizens.
By a constant use of the name of his uncle, he succeeded in cozening a
people who sought only permanence in their institutions; and Antony
being ultimately subdued, more by his own feebleness as a voluptuary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
than by the strength of his opponent, an empire fell into the hands of
Octavius. He was invested with the title of Imperator for life; and
he retained his position till his death&mdash;a circumstance to be attributed
to the conviction that had been brought home to the popular mind, that
the constant changing of the head of a State is a source of constant
danger to the peace and happiness of the whole community.<br /><br /></p>

<h5>NOTICES OF THE PRESS.</h5>

<p class="blockquot">"This volume is well qualified to receive
popular approval, but it has, beyond this, other
recommendations. It is a first-class book, and
it is a first-class scientific book as regards its
execution.... As a scientific book, the
authors have well done their part too; for they
have given us a clear, correct, and comprehensive
scientific account of the plants they have
treated on, adding such popular information as
the subject admitted of; and they have given
us, in addition, well-executed magnified dissections
of the parts essential for scientific study."&mdash;<i>Illustrated
London News.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">"For this kind of work Nature-Printing is
exactly adapted. Every delicate and inimitable
ramification is most attractively and accurately
represented. The fifty-six plates in this volume
can scarcely be surpassed, and have not, as far
as we know, been equalled.... We have
found them pleasing, and still pleasing during
several inspections. The volume is handsomely
got up, and will make a very attractive drawing-room
table-book at home or at the sea-side."&mdash;<i>Athenæeum.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">"The process by which it is produced is that
delightful one which has been a labour of love
to Mr. Henry Bradbury in bringing to perfection,
and which was first applied to the
Ferns. To speak of the accuracy of the plates
is of course a misnomer. They are of the nature
of photographs; and the only possible drawback
to the work is, that its extreme beauty will
banish to the drawing-room table, as a mere
example of pretty drawing, what, as a scientific
manual, has not been equalled.&mdash;<i>Saturday
Review.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">"Mr. Henry Bradbury's 'Nature-Printed
British Sea-Weeds' is now completed by the
appearance of the fourth volume. The authors
have added sketches of the history of British
Sea-Weeds, of their geographical distribution, of
their structure, and of their uses. There are
also chapters on arranging Algæ for the Herbarium,
on the families and genera, on the species,
and on the bibliography of the subject, the
whole concluding with a glossary of scientific
terms, and a complete Index. The whole work
now forms four volumes unsurpassed for beauty
even in the rich field of Natural History."&mdash;<i>Gardeners'
Chronicle.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">The</span> Publishers of this Work have to announce a change in its mode of
issue. The necessity for this change rests upon the following representation
of the Author, which appears to the Publishers as conclusive as
they trust it will be satisfactory to the Public.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I have been occupied," says Mr. Knight, "during nearly five years, in writing the
Popular History of England, for Monthly Publication. With three exceptions it has
appeared regularly during that period; and has now reached to Fifty-three Numbers,
bringing up the narrative to 1793. I now find it impossible,&mdash;in the first place, with a
proper regard to my own health, and, secondly, with an anxious desire to complete my
book in a way to justify the favour with which it has been received,&mdash;to proceed with a
<i>Monthly</i> Publication. The pressure of a periodical issue, with so short an interval
between each publication, has become incompatible, according to my view, with a due
regard to the research and thought which are necessary to deal with the vast accumulation
of materials for history since the period of the French Revolution. The difficulty which
now presses upon my responsibility for accuracy and impartiality has not been felt by me
in the earlier stages of my undertaking, when the field of investigation was more limited.
It has now become so onerous as to demand a decisive change.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I propose, therefore, that it should be announced that the publication in Monthly
Numbers will be discontinued, and therefore that a Number will not appear on the 1st of
October.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"That the quantity required to complete Vol. VII. will be published as a Part, or
Section in the month of January, 1861, simultaneously with the publication of the Volume.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"That Volume VIII., completing the work, will be published in the course of 1861;
and, for the convenience of purchasers, will be divided into two Parts, or Sections."</p>

<p class="blockquot">In making this announcement the Publishers have only to add, that on
the appearance of each of the Parts, or Sections, the Work will also be on
sale in the usual form of Shilling Numbers.</p>

<hr style="width: 25%;" />

<p class="blockquot">&#9758; <i>The Six Volumes of the</i> <span class="smcap">Popular History of England</span>, <i>which are
now completed, bring down the narrative from the Invasion of Cæsar to
the close of the American War. The first Four Volumes, forming the
First Division of the Work, carry down the history to the Revolution of
1688, and are published with a copious Index. The Second Division,
commencing with Volume V., will come down to that period of the
reign of her present Majesty which has become a constitutional epoch in
the important change of the commercial policy of the country. The price
of each Volume is 9s.</i></p>

<h3><br /><br />Transcriber's Notes</h3>

<p>Numerous errors in punctuation (mostly missing periods) have been
silently corrected. Otherwise, the somewhat eccentric use of punctuation
has been left untouched.</p>

<p>The following typographical errors  have been corrected:</p>

<p>"Publiliu" (p. xi) &mdash; corrected to "Publilius";<br />
"educa-" (p.6) &mdash; corrected to "education";<br />
"isin" (p. 38) &mdash; corrected to "nisi";<br />
"vain for his recal" (p. 43) &mdash; corrected to "vain for his recall";<br />
"it it is said" (p. 94) &mdash; corrected to "it is said";<br />
"Romans to continuue (p. 117) &mdash; corrected to "Romans to continue";<br />
"Hasbrubal" (p. 190) &mdash; corrected to "Hasdrubal";<br />
"to day" (p. 241) &mdash; corrected to "to-day";<br />
"Sertorious" (p. 277) &mdash; corrected to "Sertorius";<br />
"ttifled" (p. 297) &mdash; corrected to "stifled".</p>

<p>There are many examples of words with two spellings: one with a hyphen and one without; this seems often to be deliberate (and often for humorous purpose) and they have therefore been left unchanged (e.g. dis-gusted and disgusted; Ro-man and Roman).</p>

<p>There is no consistency in the use of the æ ligature. For example, Both Æmilius and Aemilius, Præneste and Praeneste are found. These inconsistencies have been left unaltered.</p>

<p>Similarly the spelling Maximùs, which appears in a footnote on p. 16, has been left unaltered, although the spelling elsewhere is Maximus.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
